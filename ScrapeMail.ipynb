       "['The first and last supermoon of the year will rise above the horizon in the east on Sunday and loom larger and brighter than normal as it climbs in the night sky until it sets the next morning.\\nKnown in the Farmer’s Almanac as the cold moon, the long night moon, and the moon before yule, the event comes as the December full moon coincides with the body’s close approach to Earth, making it appear 7% larger and 15% brighter than average.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSupermoon science: November 2016 moon biggest and brightest in 60 years\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe moon’s orbit is not perfectly circular and its distance from Earth varies from around 222,000 miles to more than 250,000 miles over the course of a month. A full moon arises when the Earth sits directly between the sun and the moon.\\nThe supermoon will rise from around 4.15pm GMT in Britain, but will be nearest to Earth shortly before 9am on Monday morning. When close to the horizon, the moon may take on a reddish hue, because the sunlight it reflects passes through more of the Earth’s atmosphere, which strips out blue light more than red.\\n\\nSupermoon: difference in size between the smallest and largest moon appearances\\n\\nFor most observers, the shorter distance to the moon will make so little difference to its appearance as to be imperceptible. The difference between the largest full moon and the smallest as seen from Earth is on a par with the difference between a 1p and 5p coin.\\n“It’ll be slightly bigger and brighter, but whether you can tell that from looking at it without an average full moon to compare it with is a moot point,” said Marek Kukula, public astronomer at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.\\n\\nSupermoon: orbit showing the closest and most distant points\\n\\nThe most dramatic views of the supermoon in the UK are expected soon after moonrise when it still hugs the horizon and appears huge against the backdrop of the skyline. The effect is down to the poorly-understood “moon illusion”, in which the moon seems bigger when viewed next to familiar, nearby objects such as trees, churches and tower blocks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSupermoon – in pictures\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“A full moon is always a really lovely sight to see,” said Kukula, “And as the moon rises on Sunday, you’ll get a feeling that this is a big-looking moon.”\\nAs ever for observers in Britain, the sight could be completely obscured by cloud. According to the Met Office, much of the country may be under cloud on Sunday afternoon and evening. With weather coming in from the west, the best spots to view the supermoon are expected to be in the east of England, through thinning and occasional breaks in the cloud.\\nIf the weather fails to cooperate, a virtual telescope project aims to livestream footage of the supermoon from its robotic telescopes. But if watching on a screen misses the mark, it is not long until the next supermoon, when conditions may be more favourable. The next two full moons, on 2 and 31 January, both qualify as supermoons. The latter is technically a super blue moon, as it will be the second full moon in a calendar month. Rarer still, it will pass directly through Earth’s shadow, creating a super blue moon eclipse.',\n",
       " \"A new generation cancer drug has raised hopes for those living with HIV after it was found to reduce the reservoir of dormant HIV cells in the body and boost the immune response of a patient.\\nDoctors say the effect the cancer drug nivolumab appeared to have on the patient offers a tantalising hope that it might provide a way to eradicate the virus from patients.\\n“This first report of a successful depletion of the HIV reservoirs opens new therapeutic perspectives towards an HIV cure,” the authors of the study write in a letter to the journal Annals of Oncology.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChild treated for HIV at birth is healthy nine years on without further treatment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n The results are based on findings from a 51-year-old man who had HIV since 1995, and was being treated for lung cancer. After relapsing less than six months after surgery and first-line chemotherapy, he was given the drug nivolumab.\\nThe man then showed a dramatic reduction in reservoirs of HIV-infected cells and increased activity from CD8 “killer” T-cells, a key immune system attack weapon. \\n“This is the first demonstration of this mechanism working in humans. It could have implications for HIV patients, both with and without cancer, as it can work on HIV reservoirs and tumour cells independently,” said Prof Jean-Philippe Spano, head of the medical oncology department at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital AP-HP in Paris, who led the research. “The absence of side effects in this patient is also good news, and suggests this could be an optimum treatment for HIV-infected patients with cancer.”\\nBut, the team also urge caution, noting that in another patient with HIV where nivolumab was administered there was no drop in the reservoir of dormant cells, while they also note the need to study the toxicity of such drugs in those with HIV.\\nThe drug appears to have the effect of “waking up” white blood cells that are infected with HIV but which are lying low in reservoirs around the body and are not producing HIV. In this state the cells are unable to be attacked by anti-retroviral therapy or the immune system, but when reactivated – and the cells start to produce HIV – they can be.\\n “Increasingly, researchers have been looking into the use of certain drugs that appear to re-activate the latent HIV-infected cells,” said Spano. “This could have the effect of making them visible to the immune system, which could then attack them.” \\nIf the reservoirs are cleared of dormant infected cells, patients could potentially be cured. \\nThe patient, the team note, has been given 31 injections of nivolumab, administered every 14 days since December 2016. While the man’s HIV levels initially increased, they then dropped and the activity of certain T-cells, including CD8 “killer” T-cells, rose.\\nBy 120 days after treatment began the team say a dramatic and sustained drop in the levels of dormant infected cells was observed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScientists testing HIV cure report 'remarkable' progress after patient breakthrough\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExperts warn it is too soon to celebrate, noting that it was not clear if the reservoirs would regrow, and that results from other cancer patients with HIV who had been given nivolumab were as yet unreported.\\nProf Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said the caution was merited. “We need larger randomised trials to see if this or similar anti-cancer drugs might have a notable effect on the HIV reservoir,” he said. “Until we have such data, talks of cure are premature, but it could lead to new approaches in dealing with HIV.”\\nThe news comes on the same day that a new study into a vaccine against HIV is launched, covering countries including South Africa, Malawi and Zimbabwe. The trial, which involves 2,600 sexually active women followed up over three years, will explore the efficacy of a placebo compared to a vaccine based on two shots and which is designed to provide protection against multiple strains of HIV.\\nAnother boost comes from the New England Medical Journal, which bears further good news, revealing that a US-funded programme to prevent HIV is having a positive effect in Uganda’s rural Rakai District.\\nThe approach, which included making anti-HIV drugs freely available to those with the virus as well as offering condoms, advice and voluntary male circumcision, led to a 42% drop in the rate of new HIV infections between the start of the programme in the early 2000s and 2016.\",\n",
       " \"A Japanese doctor who has stood up to a campaign of misinformation around a common anti-cancer vaccine has won a prestigious prize for championing evidence in the face of hostility and personal threats.\\nRiko Muranaka at Kyoto University was awarded the 2017 John Maddox prize on Thursday for her efforts to explain the safety of the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine amid strong opposition from anti-vaccine activists and a small group of academics.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe know it's effective. So why is there opposition to the HPV vaccine ?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMuranaka was praised by colleagues for her courage and leadership as she endured insults, litigation and attempts to undermine her professional status as the HPV vaccine came under attack in Japan. While the jab is used without fuss in many countries, in Japan and some other nations, fears raised by campaigners have hit vaccine uptake rates.\\nBritain has offered the HPV vaccine on its national immunisation program since 2008. The jab protects against several strains of HPV that cause nearly all cases of cervical cancer, a disease that claims more than quarter of a million lives globally each year.\\nMuranaka began writing about the vaccine after Japanese TV stations and other national media carried unconfirmed reports of immunised children experiencing pain, walking problems, seizures and other neurological issues. Some parents posted videos of their children online, claiming their symptoms were caused by the HPV jab. Despite its own health ministry finding no evidence that the vaccine was to blame, the Japanese government suspended proactive recommendations for the jab in 2013.\\nUncritical media coverage and the government’s stance spread concern over the jab’s safety and vaccination rates in Japan have crashed from more than 70% to less than 1% in recent years. The situation was compounded by a small number of doctors proposing a new condition, namely HPV vaccination-associated neuro-immunopathic syndrome, or HANS, based on patients’ complaints. The Japanese government committee to review vaccine reactions has concluded that the symptoms are probably psychosomatic.\\nMuranaka said sensational media coverage helped spread unfounded fears over the HPV vaccine across Japan. “I was really surprised that people believed it so easily. With screening and this vaccine we could prevent many deaths from this disease in Japan, but we are not taking the opportunity,” she said. A handful of other countries are witnessing similar trends, with Ireland and Denmark both experiencing falls in HPV vaccination rates. \\nIn June, the World Health Organisation (WHO) restated that there was no evidence the vaccine caused the reported illnesses. The WHO’s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety said that “despite the extensive safety data available for this vaccine, attention has continued to focus on spurious case reports and unsubstantiated allegations.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHPV infection rates plummet after vaccine with China the next frontier\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMuranaka is now embroiled in a court case with another doctor who was commissioned by the Japanese government to investigate adverse reactions to the vaccine. Shuichi Ikeda at Shinshu University claimed that mouse studies revealed a link between the vaccine and brain damage. Muranaka claims that Ikeda fabricated the results, and while a university investigation cleared him of that specific charge, it criticised Ikeda for presenting early data from a single mouse as conclusive medical evidence.\\nIn speaking out, Muranaka has been threatened and accused of being in the pay of the vaccine’s manufacturers, or the government, to promote the jab, and even of being a “WHO spy”. \\nThe John Maddox prize is awarded by the journal Nature, the Kohn Foundation, and the charity Sense about Science, to people who promote science and evidence on matters of public interest. Previous winners include the psychiatrist Simon Wessely, who faced death threats for his work on chronic fatigue syndrome and mental health, and Elizabeth Loftus, whose work on false memories propelled her into controversies over the unreliability of eyewitness testimonies and recovered memories of child abuse.\\n“I really hope that the prize helps scientists and journalists in Japan to speak more about the truth,” Muranaka said. “I hope it will help people take the side of science.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Guardian view on vaccinations: a matter of public health | Editorial\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeidi Larson, director of the vaccine confidence project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said there was no scientific evidence linking HPV to the reported neurological symptoms. “The dramatic drop in vaccine acceptance has been influenced by aggressive negative social media, mainstream media that has been biased towards the negative personal stories, as well as, and very importantly, the government not standing up for the vaccine and the vaccine science in the face of public anxiety and uncertainty,” she said.\\n“The parents of the young women who have had these reactions are convinced that these symptoms are caused by the vaccination and are unlikely to change their minds,” Larson said. “But it is important for young women who have not yet been vaccinated, and for their parents, to have more information on the number of girls around the world who have been successfully vaccinated without any negative reactions, and to understand better what it means to have cervical cancer.\\nKatsuyuki Kinoshita, head of the Japanese Association of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who nominated Muranaka for the prize, said: “Her courageous challenge in demonstrating the safety of the HPV vaccine, despite insult, litigation and attempts to undermine her professional status, epitomises the core spirit of the Maddox prize.”\",\n",
       " \"Doctors are wrong to assume that type 1 diabetes mainly affects children, according to a new study that shows it is equally prevalent in adults.\\nThe findings, published in the journal Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology, overturn previous thinking that the form of diabetes, an auto-immune condition, is primarily a childhood illness. Scientists from Exeter University found that in a lot of cases it was actually misdiagnosed among adults.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEverything you wanted to know about diabetes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Diabetes textbooks for doctors say that type 1 diabetes is a childhood illness. But our study shows that it is prevalent throughout life. The assumption among many doctors is that adults presenting with the symptoms of diabetes will have type 2 but this misconception can lead to misdiagnosis with potentially serious consequences,” said Dr Richard Oram, a senior lecturer at the University of Exeter and consultant physician.\\nThe research, funded by the Wellcome Trust and Diabetes UK, was based on the UK Biobank, a resource which includes data and genetic information from 500,000 people aged between 40 and 69 from across the country. Participants provided blood, urine and saliva samples for future analysis, detailed information about themselves and agreed to have their health followed.\\n“The key thing we were looking for with this study was whether people presented with type 1 diabetes in adulthood and at what age this occurred. This was only possible because of the unique combination of health records and genetic data,” said Oram.\\n“What was really surprising in our research is that nearly 50% of type 1 diabetes cases occurred in adulthood and over 40% occurred after the age of 30 … Although type 1 occurs with the same frequency in adults and children, it can sometimes be hidden in adulthood by the sheer number of type 2 cases.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDiabetes: can you really eat to beat it?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nType 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas produces little or no insulin, probably caused by genetic and environmental factors. It has typically been viewed as a disease of childhood and adolescence as it accounts for more than 85% of diabetes in under 20s.\\nType 2 diabetes is more common and accounts for 96% of diabetes cases in adults. It is caused by a combination of the body becoming resistant to the hormone insulin, and relative deficiency in insulin, leading to high blood sugar. A combination of genetics and lifestyle factors can cause type 2 diabetes.\\nAbout 90% of the 3.7 million diabetics in the UK have type 2, which is closely associated with obesity, while the other 10% have type 1, according to Diabetes UK.\\nDistinguishing between the two types will determine a course of treatment. Type 1 diabetics need to be injected with insulin to control blood sugar levels. With Type 2 diabetes there is still insulin produced, so it can be treated initially with diet and tablet therapy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRisk of diabetes type 1 'can be tripled by childhood stress'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe researchers say it is crucial that type 1 is diagnosed and treated correctly, as it can be life threatening. They found that one in nine of the adult onset type 1 diabetes had been admitted to hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis, a potentially fatal condition that can develop when people with type 1 diabetes are not given insulin or when they are unwell for other reasons.\\nProf Andrew Hattersley, professor of molecular medicine at the University of Exeter, said: “Type 1 diabetes is often mistaken for type 2 in adults. The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in middle and old age is very difficult … Failure to recognise [it] … and give appropriate insulin treatment can be dangerous. Type 1 diabetes should be considered for any patient who is rapidly failing to respond to increasing doses of tablets, especially if they are slim.” \\nThe report notes that among those to be misdiagnosed is prime minister Theresa May, who developed type 1 diabetes in her 50s. The condition was first misdiagnosed as being type 2 and she was given tablets which did not control her blood sugar. \\nDr Emily Burns of Diabetes UK said: “With increasing age, type 2 diabetes becomes more common, making type 1 diabetes less easy to identify. While more research is needed to understand the realities of misdiagnosis, we’d ask healthcare professionals to have this insight in mind: don’t rule out type 1 diabetes after the age of 30.”\",\n",
       " 'A longstanding row in animal evolution has come to a head, with a team of scientists claiming they have ended the debate over which type of creature is the sister of all other animals.\\nResearchers have been torn for years over whether sponges or marine invertebrates known as comb jellies were the first type of creature to branch off the evolutionary tree from the common ancestor of all animals. \\nNow researchers say the debate is over: the sponges have won.\\n“We need to try to understand the sponges much better if we want to understand the nature of animals’ – and our own – deepest ancestry,” said Davide Pisani, co-author of the research and professor of phylogenomics at the University of Bristol.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSea sponge the size of a minivan discovered in ocean depths off Hawaii\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe finding, say experts, is no trivial matter, as it could have drastic implications for what the last common ancestor of all animals looked like.\\n“Sponges are simple – humble, in a sense – creatures that live at the bottom of the sea; they are filter-feeders, they don’t do much,” said Pisani. “The comb jelly is a very different creature. They are extremely pretty and rather complicated,” he added, pointing out that comb jellies look a bit like jellyfish and can propel themselves through water, create patterns of light and have both a simple nervous system and a gut – including a mouth and anus. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  A\\nMnemiopsis leidyi, a species of comb jelly known as a sea walnut. Photograph: AP\\n\\n\\n“If the comb jellies are the sister of all of us, then we either are in a situation where the last common ancestor of all the animals was quite complex, [having] a nervous system, a gut and muscles and then the sponges [lost these features] or all these things we see in the comb jellies … evolved multiple times in animals,” he said, adding that the scenario also posed other puzzles such as what the ancestral creature would have preyed on.\\n“If the sponges are the sister group of everything else … then we can assume a much simpler scenario,” said Pisani. “Then the assumption is we evolved from a filter-feeder organism.” \\nWith different models of evolutionary relationships applied to the same genetic data throwing up either a triumph for the sponge side of the debate or the comb jellies, the researchers of latest study turned to statistics to resolve the issue.\\n“With this type of approach you can evaluate the extent to which alternative models are capable of describing a dataset, so you can say ‘this model is good for this specific dataset and this model is not good’,” said Pisani.\\nThe results, published in the journal Current Biology, were clear, he said. “Models that provide a much better description of the data invariably find the sponges at the root of the tree, for all of the datasets that have been published up to now.” \\nThat, he adds, ties in well with the fact that the closest living relatives of all animals are filter-feeding aquatic organisms called choanoflagellates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNew to Nature No 126: Asbestopluma monticola\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the findings he said, should offer us all food for thought. “I think part of why people love this debate so much is the comb jellies are beautiful and the sponges are somewhat ugly. The sponge is the underdog in a sense,” he said. “So it is quite nice to know that we have really humble beginnings, rather than this glamorous start.” \\nWhile Pisani believes proponents of the comb jellies might continue the debate, he says the wrangle is drawing to a close. “From my perspective, yes, this is the last word,” he said.\\nAntonis Rokas, professor of biological sciences and biomedical informatics at Vanderbilt University, and who has previously published studies supporting the idea that comb jellies are the oldest sister group to all other animals, welcomed the research. “[It] is a great step in the right direction toward resolving the debate,” he said, adding that the analyses comparing the accuracy of models are insightful. \\nBut, he said, the new approach brings with it its own difficulties, leading him to believe the jury is still out. “With this study, the authors have significantly tipped the balance toward the sponges-sister hypothesis,” he said. “But I will eagerly await to see what are the effects of adding additional genomes from both sponge and ctenophore lineages, as well as models that do not reduce the information provided from the data, before considering the debate solved.”',\n",

Our conclusion is that a baby Hamipterus can walk but can’t fly,” Jiang said, an unexpected finding.\\n The researchers believe these pterosaurs lived in a bustling colony near a large freshwater lake. Kellner cited evidence that females gathered together to lay eggs in nesting colonies and returned over the years to the same nesting site.\\n They suspect the eggs and some juvenile and adult individuals were washed away from a nesting site in a storm and into the lake, where they were preserved and later fossilized.\\n The oblong eggs, up to about 3in (7.2cm) long, were pliable with a thin, hard outer layer marked by cracking and crazing covering a thick membrane inner layer, resembling soft eggs of some modern snakes and lizards.\\n There had been a paucity of pterosaur eggs and embryos in the paleontological record because it is difficult for soft-shelled eggs to fossilize.\\n The research was published in the journal Science.',\n",

Instead, the samples were shown to belong to eight bears and a dog. Still, scientists say the testing has shed light on the evolutionary “family tree” of bears, so that’s something at least. Much cheerier is the fascinating news that prehistoric women’s arms were stronger than those of today’s elite rowers. A bone analysis and comparison with modern women has revealed profound effect of manual agricultural labour on the human body – and shed new light on the role of women in ancient communities. Further archaeological excitement surrounded the news that experts believe they have pinpointed the place where Julius Caesar’s fleet landed to begin their invasion of Britain in 54BC – Pegwell Bay, on the eastern tip of Kent. Nearby excavations have revealed the remains of an ancient defensive base, bones and iron weapons, which point to the bay as the most likely landing spot for a Roman fleet. And finally, a new generation cancer drug offers tantalising hope for an HIV cure after boosting the immune system and reducing the reservoir of dormant HIV cells in a patient.

Various dinosaurs and early birds show that they were completely covered in feathers – even down to their toes – and had presumably exchanged scales for feathers at this point. Only later did “scales” reappear on the feet of birds, so sadly their own feathers cannot immediately tell us about how scales might have transformed. \\n\\n\\nSeven signs that you might be a mammal | Brain flapping\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nHow exactly mammals evolved lactation is another murky subject, but if you look closely, it’s clear that a mammary gland is a hypertrophied sweat gland (appetising, I know).

       " 'Prehistoric women had stronger arms than elite female rowing teams do today thanks to the daily grind of farming life, researchers have revealed, shedding light on their role in early communities.\\nThe study of ancient bones suggests that manual agricultural work had a profound effect on the bodies of women living in central Europe between about the early neolithic and late iron age, from about 5,300BC to AD100.\\n“We think a lot of what we are seeing is the bone’s response to women grinding grain, which is pretty much seated but using your arms really repetitively many hours a day,” said Dr Alison Macintosh, co-author of the research from the University of Cambridge.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat did neolithic workers eat after a hard day at Stonehenge? Sweet pork and rich cheese\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe study also reveals that the strength of women’s arm bones dropped over time – probably as technology was developed to ease manual labour. By medieval times, the strength of women’s arm bones was on a par with that of the average woman today.\\nThe research builds on previous work by the team on male leg bones, which revealed a decline in strength since the late iron age. “Early farming men had these really strong leg bones – when you compared them to living men they were close to what you see in living runners, suggesting they were really active,” said Macintosh. “Then [there is] this really progressive decline though time in bone strength, down to what you see in living sedentary undergraduate students at Cambridge.”\\nWith similar trends not seen for women, Macintosh and colleagues decided to explore whether skeletal remains could offer other clues about the roles of women in early farming communities. To do so they explored the remains of 94 women spanning about 6,000 years, from the time of the early neolithic farmers (dating back to around 5,300 BC) through to the 9th century, from countries including Germany, Austria, and northern Serbia.\\nIn addition, the team looked at scans from bones of 83 living women who fell into four groups: runners, rowers, footballers and those who were not particularly sporty. \\nThe researchers explored the strength of two bones: the tibia, or shin-bone, and the humerus – the long bone in the upper arm.\\nComparing between bones of women across the ages rather than between the sexes was crucial, said Macintosh, explaining why the team did not look at male arm bones. “Men put more bone on, and in a stronger way, in response to physical activity than women do, even if those activities are really similar,” she said. The study also notes that comparisons with modern women can also present problems – for example, that hormonal contraceptives can affect certain bone properties. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArchaeologists find possible evidence of earliest human agriculture\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe results, published in the journal Science Advances, reveal that while the arm bones of women from the neolithic to the late iron age showed variations in strength, they were stronger than those of rowers, football players, and non-athletic women for their left arm, and the latter two groups for their right. Indeed, the neolithic women had arm bones about 30% stronger than non-athletic living women.\\n“We really saw them standing out through that first 5,500 years of farming, just really consistently stronger arm bones than the majority of the living women, including the rowers,” said Macintosh. “Medieval women had much weaker arm bones than those previous prehistoric women; they looked a lot more like modern, recreationally active women.” \\nWhile grinding grain using stone tools was likely to be a key factor in boosting women’s bone strength, the researchers add that other strenuous occupations including pottery making, planting and harvesting crops, and tending livestock could also have contributed.\\nThe findings, said Macintosh, throw a spotlight on the hard graft of women and their role in farming communities. \\n“Women have been doing rigorous labour over thousands of years [and] that’s really been underestimated so far because we haven’t been comparing them to living women,” she said. “It’s highlighting those hours of work that women have been doing that have been hidden in the archaeological record until now.”',\n",
       " 'Julius Caesar’s invasion of Britain was launched from the sandy shores of Pegwell Bay on the most easterly tip of Kent, according to fresh evidence unearthed by archaeologists.\\nResearchers named the wide, shallow bay the most likely landing spot for the Roman fleet after excavators found the remains of a defensive base dating to the first century BC in the nearby hamlet of Ebbsfleet, near Ramsgate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe came, we saw, we detected: relics from Caesar era among amateur finds\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ancient base covered more than 20 hectares and would have been ideally placed to protect the 800 ships the Roman army had to haul ashore when they were battered by a storm soon after they arrived from France in 54BC.\\n“This is the first archaeological evidence we have for Julius Caesar’s invasion of Britain,” said Andrew Fitzpatrick, a researcher at the University of Leicester. “It’s a large defended site that dates to the first century BC.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Excavations at Ebbsfleet, with Pegwell Bay in the background. Photograph: Dean Barkley/University of Leice/PA\\n\\n\\nArchaeologists got their first glimpse of the Roman base while excavating land ahead of a new road project. They uncovered a deep defensive ditch that looks similar to Roman defences found at Alesia in France, site of the decisive battle in the 52BC Gallic war.\\nFurther excavations uncovered bones that appear to have been damaged in fights and iron weapons, including a Roman pilum or javelin. The archaeologists believe the site included a Roman fort and served to protect Caesar’s ships from attackers coming from the north. “The main purpose of the site is to defend the fleet,” Fitzpatrick said.\\nThe Roman general’s own account of the invasion describes how the fleet set off from France on the night of 4 July but got swept eastwards by currents when the wind failed. Early the next morning, the crew spotted England and rowed west to reach land at about noon.\\n\\nCaesar landing map\\n\\nThe fleet was left at anchor at an even and open shore, Caesar wrote, but a high tide combined with a storm to wreak havoc on the ships, which broke anchor and smashed into one another. The general had the ships drawn onto the beach and set thousands of craftsmen to repair the damage.\\nPegwell Bay had not been considered a viable landing site before because it lies on the Isle of Thanet, which was separated from mainland England until the middle ages by the Wantsum Channel. But the discovery of the Roman base makes the bay the most likely landing spot, Fitzpatrick said. “The Wantsum Channel wouldn’t have been a barrier to such accomplished engineers as the Roman army,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  The point of a Roman\\npilum found in the defensive ditch at Ebbsfleet. Photograph: University of Leicester/PA\\n\\n\\nPegwell Bay is the only large bay on the east coast of Kent with an open sandy shore that could accommodate the vast fleet, the archaeologists believe. With at least 20,000 men and two thousand horses to disembark, the ships would have taken up more than a kilometre of beach when they arrived.\\nThe British originally opposed the landing but on seeing the size of the fleet, retreated to higher ground, in positions that are now thought to be on the Isle of Thanet around Ramsgate.\\nWhile the Roman general returned to France without leaving an occupying army, the treaties Caesar set up between Rome and British royal families led to rulers of the south east of England becoming client kings of Rome. Those allegiances may have aided the invasion by the emperor Claudius nearly 100 years later in AD43.\\n“This was the beginning of the permanent Roman occupation of Britain, which included Wales and some of Scotland, and lasted for almost 400 years, suggesting that Claudius later exploited Caesar’s legacy,” said Colin Haselgrove at the University of Leicester. The findings will be explored as part of BBC Four’s Digging for Britain on Wednesday 29 November.',\n",

Sources included mummified animals found in monasteries, hair collected by nomadic herdsmen, bone from a spiritual healer and a stuffed “yeti” from the Messner Mountain Museum. \\nThe team also analysed 15 other samples from zoos, national parks and museums, the majority of which were known to be from Himalayan brown bears. \\nThe analysis, which was based on sequences of DNA from the energy powerhouses of the cell known as mitochondria, involved a comparison of all of the samples with genetic data from a large international database.\\n“Of those nine samples, eight of them matched local bears that are found in the region today,” said Lindqvist, adding that the ninth sample was the dog tooth from the stuffed yeti. “The purported yetis from the Tibetan plateau matched Tibetan brown bears, the ones from the western Himalayan mountains matched the Himalayan brown bear and then, at possibly slightly lower altitude were Asian black bears.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nG2: Reinhold Messner hunts yetis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLindqvist added that the finding produced mixed emotions. “That was obviously very interesting to me, perhaps slightly disappointing to the film company,” she said, adding that the new samples also helped the team to gain new insights into the evolutionary “family tree” of bears.\\nBut Lindqvist says she doubts the study will be the final word on the yeti. “I am sure, though, that the legend and the myth will live on,” she said. “You can never for sure prove that there is nothing out there.”\\nThe results, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, are likely to disappoint cryptozoologists. Jonathan Downes, director of the Centre for Fortean Zoology, said that while he applauded the scientific work and agreed that many samples are obviously from bears, he believes the mystery is not yet solved. \\n“I think there is still a possibility that there are unknown species of higher primate which are still awaiting discovery in what used to be Soviet central Asia,” he said.',\n",
       " 'Being married could help stave off dementia, a new study has suggested. \\nLevels of social interaction could explain the finding, experts have said, after the research showed that people who are single or widowed are more likely to develop the disease. \\nExperts conducted an analysis of 15 studies which held data on dementia and marital status involving more than 800,000 people from Europe, North and South America, and Asia. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs marriage good for your health?

They may also be more likely to be socially engaged than singletons. \\nMeanwhile, the effect observed in people who have been widowed could be due to stress that comes with bereavement, they added. Another explanation could be that developing dementia could be related to other underlying cognitive or personality traits. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDementia is greater risk for single people in later life, study finds\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommenting on the study, Dr Laura Phipps of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “There is compelling research showing married people generally live longer and enjoy better health, with many different factors likely to be contributing to that link.

       " 'The puzzle of why asthma is about twice as common in women as men may have been solved, according to researchers who say it might partly be down to testosterone.\\nWhile boys are about 1.5 times as likely to have asthma as girls, the situation changes with adolescence – a factor that has led scientists to probe whether sex hormones could be behind the trends.\\nTo unpick possible mechanisms behind the gender differences, a team of researchers from the US focused on a type of white blood cells, known as ILC2 cells, that originate in the bone marrow and become “seeded” in particular tissues of the body, including the lungs, early in life. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy do so many elite athletes have asthma?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen an allergen enters the lungs, the cells lining the airways secrete proteins which in turn trigger ILC2 to expand and produce yet more proteins, which kick off a cascade of inflammatory response.\\n“We were interested in determining whether or not sex hormones regulate these cells, since they are important in initiating the inflammatory response and so little is known about them,” said Dr Dawn Newcomb, co-author of the research from Vanderbilt University.\\nNewcomb and colleagues began by looking at the levels of ILC2 cells in the blood of a group of four healthy men and four healthy women, as well as six women and seven men with asthma. \\nThe findings, published in the journal Cell Reports, revealed individuals with asthma had higher levels of ILC2 cells than those without. Moreover, while there was little difference in levels of the cells for healthy participants, women with asthma had about twice the levels of ILC2 cells compared with men with the condition. \\nThe team then turned to mice, and found that adult females had more ILC2 cells in their lung tissue than males or young mice of either sex. \\nThey then carried out a series of experiments manipulating hormone levels in mice and probing the impact on ILC2 cells. Among their studies, the team compared the situation between mice with sex hormones present in their bodies, and those who had had their testes or ovaries removed early in life. “What we found is that the mice that lacked testosterone had significantly more ILC2 expansion and function compared to the male mice that had testosterone,” said Newcomb.\\nTogether, the results suggest that testosterone is important in dampening the expansion and protein production from the ILC2 cells in the lungs, keeping the immune response in check. \\nDr Dominick Shaw, severe asthma lead at the University of Nottingham who was not involved in the study, welcomed the research.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVitamin D supplements could halve risk of serious asthma attacks\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It appears testosterone and oestrogen change this inflammatory pathway in different ways within mouse lungs. Now mice are a long way from patients … but it is plausible,” he said, noting that more women than men have severe asthma, and changes in asthma symptoms have been linked to the menstrual cycle. “What is interesting about these data is it starts to drill down into what the sex hormones might be doing in terms of the asthma mechanisms.”\\nShaw said the study adds weight to recent efforts by pharmaceutical companies to target particular proteins involved in asthma, and that the work suggests it could be beneficial to target proteins produced by ILC2 cells.\\n“For many years asthma has been seen as a simple diagnosis, and you just give steroids. What we have realised over the last five or 10 years is that it is a highly complex diagnosis and different people have different types of asthma, so we are trying to personalise the treatments to individuals with asthma,” he said. “What this paper suggests is that there might be differential responses based on gender to some of those drugs [coming] in the future.”',\n",
       " 'What’s happening?\\nMount Agung, a volcano on the Indonesian island of Bali, has been in a state of unrest for several weeks and is now emitting smoke and ash. Mudflows, known as lahars, are running down the mountainside and loud booms have been heard. Experts say a large eruption could happen imminently. \\nWhat action has been taken?\\nThe volcano alert status has been set at the highest level and 100,000 people have been told to evacuate from a six-mile (10km) radius around the volcano, about 40,000 of whom have left the area. The airports on Bali and Lombok have been closed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMount Agung: 100,000 told to evacuate as Bali volcano spews huge ash cloud\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDavid Rothery, professor of planetary geosciences at the Open University, said the move to evacuate was wise. “It is very hard to have people in emergency shelters for such a length of time – there are all sorts of social issues that can arise – but they have done it and people have largely complied. And those few people still dangerously close to the volcano I hope will now be getting away because there could be something catastrophic about to happen.”\\nWhy might Mount Agung be about to erupt?\\nIt’s all down to pressure. Geological processes at the ocean floor mean molten rock is rising upwards with dissolved gases, including water vapour and sulphur dioxide. As the mixture – known as magma – rises, the gases form bubbles. As the pressure builds, an eruption becomes more likely.\\nHas Agung erupted before?\\nYes, the last eruption was in 1963 and killed more than 1,000 people. “Far more would die this time in a similar eruption [without evacuation] because population density has gone up,” says Rothery. \\nDavid Pyle, professor in earth sciences at the University of Oxford, said: “The evacuated area could be totally devastated by this. It is a young active volcano, and it has a long history of repeated explosive eruptions. It is the sort of volcano that probably erupts once every hundred years or so.”\\nHow hard is it to predict an eruption?\\nTelltale signals picked up by those monitoring the volcano, including changing patterns in the frequency and intensity of earthquakes beneath it, have suggested since September that an eruption is brewing, and evacuations were also carried out then. “It wouldn’t have been a surprise if it had erupted straight away, but in fact the earthquake activity died away,” said Pyle.\\nThe last eruption, which began in February 1963, involved about a month of small explosions, ash emissions, lava flows and mudflows. The big explosions, including pyroclastic flows (superheated and fast-flowing currents of gas and rock), came later, in March and May, with activity lasting nearly a year. \\nPredicting what happens next is largely based on what a particular volcano has done before. In this case, scientists have data from only one recent eruption, so for now they are assuming the activity is likely to follow a similar pattern. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow have you been affected by the Bali volcano evacuation?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat threat does the volcano pose?\\nAlthough mudflows and falling ash are hazardous, the biggest threat to humans would come from pyroclastic flows which can travel at 70 miles per hour. The likelihood of pyroclastic flows occurring depends on how the column of ash develops.\\n“If the ash just settles out of the sky, depending on how thick the ashfall is, you can kill crops or collapse roofs of buildings and so on,” said Rothery. “But if the rising column gets too heavy to support itself and it collapses, that will produce a pyroclastic flow, rushing down the sides of the volcano. Pyroclastic flows are absolutely deadly. They are hot … and they are very, very destructive.”\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nPlay Video\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n0:24\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Timelapse shows Bali volcano Mount Agung spewing ash after minor eruptions – video\\n\\n\\nWill it affect tourists?\\nThe area around Mount Agung is not a major tourist hotspot. However, Bali airport has closed, with about 59,000 people thought to have been stranded on the island.\\nHow long would an eruption last?\\nIt’s hard to tell. Based on the previous eruption, the activity seems unlikely to subside any time soon. “Our starting point would be that we’d expect the activity to play out over the next few weeks to months,” said Pyle, adding that the principle hazards at present were the mudflows and ash – which can cause disruptions both on the ground and for air transport, since ash can affect jet engines. \\n“Monitoring agencies will be running weather simulations to predict where the ash cloud will go,” he said, noting that whether flights were grounded could change from day to day.',\n",
       " 'In an old church somewhere in South London, senior computing lecturer Dr Kate Devlin lies down on top of a sleeping bag and submits to a hug from a robot. But it doesn’t look how you’d imagine a robot to look: it has no face, no hands, and none of the porny characteristics common to sex robots we see in the mainstream media. It’s a pile of plastic inflatable tubes on top of a sleeping bag, which wrap around you and pulse with air – squeezing and hugging whoever has been brave enough to lie down and try it. In my opinion it’s one of the sexiest things to come out of the Goldsmith’s sex tech hack.\\nAlthough only in its second year, the sex tech hack has already managed to throw out ideas that radically challenge the way we think about sex and tech. Broadly, the products we’re used to seeing on sale offer a recognisable upgrade to our current sex toys – vibrators that connect over the internet to allow long-distance play, or sex robots which are basically sex dolls plus a simple Siri-style AI. But at the sex tech hack, the participants’ vision of the future is altogether more unusual: exploring the edges of sensual pleasure, and taking a new look at how we communicate intimately.\\nThe sex “robot” that Dr Devlin was testing came from the imaginations of team Sense Me – they wanted to create a machine that didn’t feel like a machine: something soft that could envelop you in a hug. The inflatable plastic straps wrapped around the user, squeezing and pulsating, to give a sense of comfort and restraint.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Sexy balloons? Not\\nquite as ridiculous as it sounds. Photograph: Mikhail Tereshchenko/TASS\\n\\n\\nTeam SucCUMb explored the idea of full-body touch too, encouraging people to explore the detail of their own bodies the way they’d explore the details of an intimate partner. The product they prototyped combined augmented reality with multiple tiny vibration motors. The user would lie on a bed, looking up at a screen, where they’d see their own body in a different environment – think American Beauty, with actress Mena Suvari lying naked on a bed of falling rose petals. As the rose petals “drop” from the screen, the user feels tiny vibrations on their body. To heighten the sense that your body is not your own, they also played moaning sounds to the user, simultaneously triggering a vibrator on their throat, to make them feel as if the noises were coming from their own mouth, giving the user the strange feeling of having their pleasure led by a machine.\\nIn a similar vein, Team Fake It ‘Til You Make It explored the ways in which sex noises can enhance our experience. While there’s no hard and fast rule about what people will enjoy in bed, many of us get off more intensely if we can either make noise ourselves, or hear a partner vocally enjoying it. As the team put it: do we moan because we like it, or do we like it because we moan? The answer appears to be “a bit of both”. They trained a neural network using audio porn, and programmed a vibrator to respond with more intense vibrations when it heard what it identified as a moan.\\nSo far we’ve mostly talked about solo sex, but one of the key themes the teams were invited to explore was intimacy, which doesn’t always have to be physical, after all. I was particularly taken with Touch Pairing – an app which would pair phone screens, and display your touch gestures to another phone via colourful trails of light. The person you’d paired with could then trace your gestures back to you, and share a fingertip touch over a long distance.\\nOther teams focused on current problems within the world of sex toys and products: team Softdongs identified an issue with packers, which are soft silicone penises worn to give yourself a bulge. But off-the-shelf it’s not always easy to find a packer that suits your body and style. This team built a tool that would allow you to design your own packer, then look at it from all angles in a virtual environment, and 3D print a mould to create your own out of silicone. “VR Sexperiments” created a series of virtual reality games that allowed users to do sexual things in a virtual world. They ranged from the curious (watching a disembodied dildo run up and down your own virtual arm, while the real-life operator ran his finger along the same line, a sexy virtual demonstration of the rubber hand illusion) to the sensual (stick this controller in your belt and pleasure this virtual robot). It’s easy to see how virtual reality could allow us to live out fantasies that would be impossible in the real world. In the virtual world, I had a penis with which I could pleasure my robotic companion. Equally I could change my body to make me larger, smaller, or completely different in some other respect. Ever wanted to have sex with a cartoon tentacle monster? In virtual reality, you can make that dream come true.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  It’s very difficult to find an image that represents ‘innovative sex tech’ in the Guardian archives, so here’s whatever this is. Photograph: Jae C. Hong/AP\\n\\n\\nOther projects explored things like fetishisation of objects, how to encourage people to pay for porn, or how to improve bedroom communication using gesture recognition. Last year’s ideas featured everything from a peacock tail that responded to physical arousal, a bra that output different colours depending on how turned on you were, and a robot that wrote its own porn.\\nEverything the teams came up with was created over a weekend, and although most of the projects will never come to market, all of them demonstrated that new tech can help us radically reimagine the way we give and receive pleasure. Why is it that the things they created look so unlike some of the sex toys we see on the market today? Partly, I suspect, it’s because of the difference in the brief. Sex toy companies (barring some of the more innovative ones – a couple of which sponsored the hack itself) are generally looking to do “the same, but better” – creating more powerful vibrators, more intense masturbation sheaths, etcetera. They’re also driven by the market – in which consumers are wary of something that looks wildly different to what they’re used to. But the sex tech hack is a window into what’s possible when we’re not chained to ideas we’ve had in the past. When we’re not seeing “sex robots” as humanoid women or “sex toys” as things you just rub on your genitals.\\nWith the sex tech industry getting more attention, and consumers fascinated by stories of robots and gadgets and wifi-connected butt plugs, there’s a huge opportunity here.

       " 'You likely know that you’re a mammal. You have neither feathers nor a shell, you cannot breathe underwater and you only have to look at an ant to feel the vast spans of evolutionary time that lie between you and insects. But are you absolutely sure? Are you 100% confident that you’re a mammal, and not some exotic form of mollusc? Well, now you can be, with this easy-to-use guide!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Hair, there, everywhere. Photograph: Rosdiana Ciaravolo/Getty Images\\n\\n\\n 1) You have hair\\nAlthough we humans are no longer particularly hairy, we retain patches of this uniquely mammalian structure in a number of places. Among mammals, only dolphins – after they’ve shed the few whiskers they’re born with – are completely bald. \\n For most mammals, hair is elemental to their warm-blooded lifestyles. And, certainly for the first mammals – tiny little creatures that lived about 200m years ago – acquiring fur coats that slowed down heat loss was necessary for the evolution of warm blood. \\nIt is, though, still uncertain how hair first evolved – the usefulness of a few straggly prototype hairs is hard to fathom. They certainly wouldn’t have kept anyone warm. It’s now thought that these fine protrusions may originally have acted as either sensory structures – like whiskers do today – or they may have been wicks for getting sweat-like secretions out of the sweat glands and onto the body. And that only later did a thicker coating of them became insulating.\\nRetaining hair on our human heads makes sense. Given how much energy a brain devours, one wouldn’t want to lose too much heat there. The hair beneath our arms and on our pubis is more surprising – one theory has it that it helps waft body scents around between members of our species. \\n2) Your first meal was milk\\nWhen you were born, you were unable to digest anything other than this vital mammalian invention. Indeed, mammals are named after the glands from which we all take our first meals. Marsupials are born at a ludicrously early stage of development, then spend weeks or months permanently attached to one of their mother’s teats.\\nHow exactly mammals evolved lactation is another murky subject, but if you look closely, it’s clear that a mammary gland is a hypertrophied sweat gland (appetising, I know). Most researchers now believe that before there was nutritious milk, there was a sort of sweated abdominal secretion that pre-mammalian mothers used to coat their eggs. Such a procedure may have protected against dehydration or fought off infections – some of today’s milk proteins are suspiciously like naturally occurring antimicrobials (even more appetising, right?).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Most mammals long ago decided that shell suits were unacceptable. Photograph: Kent Gilbert/AP\\n\\n\\n3) You did not depart your mother inside an egg \\nNope, at birth you were screaming and wriggling, and ready to go. This said, a little too much has been made of mammalian live birth. Entering this world unencased in eggshell doesn’t necessarily make you a mammal – numerous reptiles and fish have dispensed with laying eggs – while platypuses and their spiny cousins, echidnas, still lay eggs, as all mammalian ancestors did, and as the first mammals also did. \\nYou are, though, a placental mammal and a placenta establishes a very dynamic relationship between foetal mammal and its mother from the get-go.\\n4) As an infant, an adult looked after you\\nDespite the absence of an eggshell, as a baby you couldn’t really do anything for yourself. While some newborn mammals are way more capable – baby wildebeests are up and running with the herd within minutes – all of them rely on their mothers for some initial postnatal care. Having all your dietary needs met by your mother’s mammaries is a very privileged upbringing. Contrast that to the majority of young reptiles who crack themselves free from their eggy origins and immediately have to fend for their themselves. (Though birds, like mammals, are also very diligent parents.) \\nThe close bond between mother and young that was founded on milk also allowed the possibility of culture exchange between generations to evolve. And the neurobiology of these bonds may have provided the foundations for further social (and romantic) bonds between mammals.\\n 5) You have a diaphragm\\nAs a mammal, you have – unlike any other type of animal – a sheet of muscle across the bottom of your rib-cage. Leonardo da Vinci thought the diaphragm functioned to keep your body’s spiritual parts – your heart and lungs – separated from your baser parts – such as your stomach and guts. But what the diaphragm actually does is make you breathe far more powerfully.\\nBeing a mammal is a demanding task – your organs demand constant fuelling – so, you need to breathe and eat six to ten times more than a cold-blooded animal. Given this cost, the advantages of being warm-blooded are actually pretty hard to pin down. Some have suggested it’s actually just a by-product of being able to occasionally run hard, fast and long; others have said the demands of parenting might have required warm blood. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  You know what they say about creatures with big brains. They need larger hats than most. Photograph: Science Photo Library - ZEPHYR./Getty Images\\n\\n\\n6) Your brain is strikingly large\\nYou’re a human, so of course you consider your abundance of cranial contents a zoological triumph. This said, whales and elephants have substantially bigger brains than you do. What makes yours special is its size relative to that of your body – it is about four-times bigger than a chimp’s and three times bigger than a gorilla’s, whose body-sizes are roughly comparable to yours. However, while ancient hominids made quite the cerebral leap forward, the evolution of mammals saw an even greater hike in brain size.\\nAs mammals first emerged, becoming increasingly warm-blooded, fossils of their craniums reveal a quite rapid expansion. Today, compared to a similarly sized reptile, a mammal’s brain is 10 times larger.\\nAdditionally, while there’s clearly something unique about human brains, it’s actually quite difficult to identify stark anatomical or genetic differences between our brain and those of other primates. But the grey matter that covers a human brain – the wrinkled mass of microscopically layered cerebral cortex – is a tissue that exists only in mammals. It’s thought to have evolved just before the arrival of true mammals as a new way of building a brain. Made mainly of this tissue, and dependent on own warm-bloodedness for its high running costs, the human brain is very, very much a mammalian brain. \\n7) You are an animal whose biology was profoundly shaped by a 100m year stretch of evolution that ran from about 300m to 200m years ago, and which sculpted from some reptile-like ancestors (who’d recently evolved from the earliest ever land-living vertebrates) a new type of animal – a mammal – that possessed a suite of traits that continue both to define how you live today, and which enabled the emergence of all the quirky traits that make your human life so very, very interesting.\\nYes, to understand what makes our curious species tick, you need to understand the evolution of human-only traits like our brains and complex language, our nimble hands and upright posture. But to fully understand how we got wo where we are today, it’s good to acknowledge our mammalian heritage and how we share this with the other five-and-a-half-thousand species of mammal with whom we share this planet.\\n Liam Drew is a writer and former neurobiologist.

       " 'It is finally becoming common knowledge to the general public that birds really are dinosaurs. What’s more, an ever-increasing number of discoveries gives us incredible insight into the form and diversity of feathers in various non-avian dinosaurs and early birds. We have a growing understanding of how feathers spread and changed in various lineages, their functions, and why they might have evolved in the first place but a fundamental gap remains in our understanding – how did they evolve?\\nFeathers are composed of keratin, which also makes up scales (and for that matter claws and parts of skin – and, indeed, our own hair) and they are both growth of the skin, so presumably they have some kind of shared evolutionary history – but that is about as far as researchers have got. There are a number of suggested pathways to get from scale to feather, but while some are well thought of, none are especially well thought of. Complicating the process are the odd patterns that evolution has thrown up from time to time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Various feather types are seen in numerous fossils such as these on the arm of the dinosaur\\nAnchiornis Photograph: David Hone\\n\\n\\nAlthough modern birds have scaly feet, these are, in fact, very heavily modified feathers and not some hold-over from their dinosaurian ancestry. Various dinosaurs and early birds show that they were completely covered in feathers – even down to their toes – and had presumably exchanged scales for feathers at this point. Only later did “scales” reappear on the feet of birds, so sadly their own feathers cannot immediately tell us about how scales might have transformed. \\nIn 2014, a new and very unusual dinosaur called Kulindadromeus was unearthed in Siberia, which appeared to show not just feather-like filaments, but that some of these were growing out of scales. Although this little animal is from a very different lineage that that which gave rise to birds, it suggests at least that some feather-like structures might have evolved directly from highly modified scales. \\nEnter a new study published last week (Wu et al., 2017), which looks at how scales and feathers form. The researchers took genes thought to be important in feather development and had them expressed in embryos of alligators and chickens during the development of scales and feathers respectively. They also identified some new genes that regulate the genes for development and changed their degrees of activity to further alter these changes. \\nIn modifying these various genes, they were able to produce new kinds of modified scales. True, these were not feathers from alligators, but they do show that relatively simple changes to a few genes can cause the early development of scales even in modern alligators to produce things with much in common with the ancestral feathers that we see in early non-avian dinosaurs. In short, it’s not a massive step from these to something like a true early feather, not least when you consider that the alligator lineage split from that of birds over 250m years ago. Couple that with the fact than any early “proto-feathers” that conferred a benefit on their owners would be under natural selection to retain and refine them, and it’s not a big jump to suggest that feathers may have formed relatively easily. \\nModification of the genes in the chickens produced a variety of feather forms, including those seen in various dinosaurs, so the gap from scale to feather is at least partly bridged from the other side by this study. Some of these too match the theoretical steps between feathers and scales that have been proposed, and this suggests that we have been on the right track for a while, if lacking in some supporting evidence which is now being discovered.\\nClearly there is some way to go, but the identification of only a few genes, still present in modern crocodilians such as alligators, that can be changed quite easily into rather simple feather-like filaments is most intriguing. There is a huge diversity in the feathers seen in the dinosaurs on the run-up to birds, as well as those in other dinosaur lineages and their relatives the flying pterosaurs, and this shows the possibilities when it comes to filaments. A few more tweaks to these genes might show us the complete pathways from scale to feather – and then the real question of how birds became birds and first grew their feathers can, perhaps, be answered. \\nReferences:\\nWu, P., Yan, J., Lai, Y.C., Ng, C.S., Li, A., Jiang, X., Elsey, R., Widelitz, R., Bajpai, R., Li, W.H. and Chuong, C.M., 2017.

       " 'An anthropologist, an explorer and a tourist walk into a bar. They’re each clutching a spear. The anthropologist describes how it was presented to her on her seventh fieldwork season by the elders of the tribe. The explorer regales them with the tale of how he won the spear upon completing an initiation challenge the tribe had set for him, filmed for a documentary. The tourist explains that he paid $10 for his at the market, and needs to get back now otherwise the cruise ship will leave without him … \\nThe media attention about the misadventure and recent rescue of British explorer Benedict Allen from Papua New Guinea, and the debate over whether his exploits are culturally appropriate in a post-colonial world, raise a question that’s at the heart of anthropology itself. Why do we travel to other cultures? Who, if anyone, gives permission? Are only some reasons for travel valid? And once you’re there, what understanding do you hope to achieve?\\nMany of the first practitioners of anthropological enquiry were missionaries and speculators seeking opportunities for travel, trade and religious conversion of colonial “natives”. Theirs was research with a heavy agenda. Fundamental to these early researchers’ understanding was that these races were less civilised by virtue of biology. Carolus Linnaeus, who created the taxonomic system we still use today to describe all species, described four geographical varients of human, Homo, in his Systema Natura in 1758. Europaeus albus, white Europeans, were muscular, sanguine, inventive and governed by laws – their species cousins were between them obstinate, merry, crafty or covetous, and governed variously by custom (Americanus), opinion (Asiaticus) or caprice (Africanus).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  A Papuanese man poses at the Baliem Valley Cultural Festival in Wamena, Indonesia. Photograph: Agung Parameswara/Getty Images\\n\\n\\nIn those days, describing the physiology, thought and customs of a tribal native in a distant colony was no more epistemologically problematic than studying the physiology and behaviour of a species of exotic bird. You wouldn’t ask the native for an interpretation of their culture any more than you would ask an animal to explain life in the forest. You – the white European - would observe, describe and explain. You created and curated the truth. A good expedition report was a way to both prove your bravery and your empirical rationality. Derring-do and carefully described specimens – bird, beast and human – would get you ahead when you finally got back to Civilisation. \\nRacial and cultural theory have moved on, but nonetheless, it provokes the question of how, given shared roots, anthropologists and explorers are different to one another. \\nAllen described his objective as tracking down a band of people “out-of-contact with our interconnected world”. He insists his work as a professional adventurer-explorer “… isn’t about conquering nature, planting flags or leaving your mark. It’s about the opposite: opening yourself up and allowing the place to leave its mark on you.” That, he explains, is the reason for not taking GPS or satellite phone, which would be standard safety equipment for most remote expeditions. If the locals can’t leave when a dangerous situation or illness occurs, why then, should their white-skinned guest? \\nOne of the principal techniques of ethnographic anthropological field research is participant-observation. The idea is that the anthropologist attempts to live in and become part of the community and culture that he or she is trying to understand. The anthropologist can experience life as an embedded subject, and yet step “out” enough to be able to observe as an objective researcher. Back and forth goes the yo-yo of research – steeped in the complexity of real life, and becoming a more insightful, nuanced observer at the same time. It takes a long time – often years rather than months – to build a body of knowledge. An anthropologist may well have a satellite phone and GPS – but they’re just two additional facts that stand them apart from their hosts, along with their clothes, stature, education, language, skin colour, vaccination programme and regime of anti-malarial tablets (for example). Anthropology acknowledges the problematic nature of the knowledge of others - you can never be fully objective in your observations, perceived as they are through the lens of your personal experience and identity. You’ll never be fully “participant” either – you’ll always be an anthropologist “other”, even if you’re also a member of the community.\\nFor anthropologists in the field, scrutinising personal responses to experiences is part of being a good, reflexive researcher. But for most, the personal remains peripheral. The central focus is the group of people you’re studying. \\nAnd yet anthropologists in the field may well want to make a name for themselves, are expected to show the impact of their research back “home” and seek to raise awareness and understanding of the people they’re studying. Self-interested motives can easily lie alongside the desire to help an indigenous community. Plenty of communities might not benefit at all from an anthropologist’s academic output. \\nExplorers tend to be upfront and unapologetic about their quest for adventure. They seek remote and difficult destinations to test and learn about themselves as much as the people they meet. Rainforest and mountain become proving ground and playground, as well as a way to tell a story about a place and people the rest of us might not otherwise know about. \\nAnd what of the non-professional? Can tourists visit remote places and seldom-contacted people ethically? Or is is always degrading and exploitative to the indigenous people? In some places I’ve travelled, it feels like tribal tourism exploits the tourists seeking an “authentic” cultural experience more than it exploits the entrepreneurial locals offering dance performances, traditional costume, or market knick-knacks. \\nIt’s perhaps as patriarchal – with all the echoes of colonial-era racism – to suggest that it’s for “us” to decide what is or isn’t ok for “them”. Maybe the remote Papua New Guinean tribe want to welcome the same white guy who last showed up thirty years ago. Maybe once-remote peoples see holidaying visitors as a key revenue stream for their 21st-century lives. And maybe the adventurous anthropologist with tenure in mind is no more or less self-interested than the tourist who wants an exotic selfie for instagram, or the explorer who wants another yarn to tell.',\n",
       " 'I’ve been gripped by the story of Antarctic ‘ice cliff instability’ ever since Rob DeConto and Dave Pollard published their controversial predictions last year. They suggested disintegration of ice shelves caused by global warming could leave behind coastal ice cliffs so tall they would be unstable, crumbling endlessly into the ocean and causing rapid, sustained sea level rise. \\nI’m glad Eric Holthaus is writing about an impact of climate change that is both certain (seas will rise around the world, no matter what we do) and incredibly important (we must adapt). I’m sympathetic to his concerns about the future. But I think his article is too pessimistic: that it overstates the possibility of disaster. Too soon, too certain.\\nI’ll admit my fascination is personal. In late 2015, Catherine Ritz and I co-led a study about the future of Antarctica, and our predictions – though definitely bad news – were far less dire. So what evidence do we have that the Antarctic ice sheet could, or would, collapse this century? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe climate has changed before. But this is different – look at the archeological record\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst, it’s important to map out what is known. Yes, the Antarctic ice sheet is vulnerable to global warming. Not because it will melt in the warm air like an ice cube, but because the ice shelves around the coastlines act as bracing for the glaciers. When the surface of an ice shelf melts it can disintegrate, and the flow of ice into the oceans can speed up: we saw this for Larsen B in 2002. Our greenhouse gas emissions make this more likely. \\nYes, scientists have proposed that disintegration of ice shelves could trigger two types of ‘instability’ that may have caused the ‘marine’ parts of the Antarctic ice sheet (lying on bedrock below sea level) to drastically reduce in the past, raising sea levels by several metres. Confusingly, these are named ‘marine ice sheet instability’ and ‘marine ice cliff instability’. Broadly speaking, both are based around the idea that the thicker the edge of the ice sheet, the faster ice can be lost into the oceans. Both may be ‘positive feedbacks’: in other words, self-sustaining. The marine parts of the ice sheet are thicker in the middle than at the edges, so once these proposed instabilities started, they would keep going until they ran out of ice. As Eric says, this would be over three metres worth of sea level rise.\\nYes, one instability may already be happening. In 2014, new evidence suggested marine ice sheet instability may be underway in the Amundsen Sea area, forty years after it was first predicted. But Eric is wrong to say Antarctica’s ‘ice budget’ has tipped out of balance due to our burning of fossil fuels. Not only has it been out of balance before – such as the ancient West Antarctic collapse that causes concern – but the reason for the Amundsen Sea changes, where most ice is being lost, is that the ring of deep warm water around Antarctica has welled up onto the continental shelf and is melting the ice from underneath. We don’t know if human activities made this more likely.\\nAs far as I know, scientists agree the basic theory of marine ice cliff instability by Jeremy Bassis and Catherine Walker is sound (it’s a shame Catherine’s joint contribution to that key 2011 paper wasn’t mentioned). Ice is not strong enough to form a sheer cliff taller than about 100 m above the water line. And indeed, we don’t see any ice cliffs taller than this, which gives us indirect evidence their calculations are correct. We also have the recent study led by Matthew Wise of marks left by the keels of ancient icebergs, scraping along the bedrock like heavy ships, which point towards this kind of cliff collapse in the distant past.\\nBut there is little consensus in the scientific community about how this ice cliff instability could behave. That’s because there is a big leap from identifying a potential problem and predicting the real world consequences. Iceberg scrape marks, though important, can’t tell us how soon, how fast, or for how long. Rob DeConto and Dave Pollard have been the first to put their heads above the parapet, but others may come to different conclusions. Ted Scambos mentioned ‘piles of icebergs’ acting as new ice shelves. Could cold freshwater from melted icebergs also slow things down? Could cliffs partially, instead of catastrophically, crumble? Would a model with finer detail predict fewer tall cliffs? Eric describes the collapse rate as conservative compared with Jakobshavn in Greenland, but this compares apples with oranges: the rapid ice losses from that great glacier are mostly due to its unusually fast speed, rather than the rate of retreat of the ice edge. \\nJust as important is the initial trigger: how sensitive are the ice shelves to global warming? In Rob and Dave’s study, they disintegrated fast and early: predictions by others are less pessimistic. Eric compounds this by describing their highest scenario as ‘business as usual’, but it’s really business-worse-than-usual. Under current policies we’re headed for less warming than this scenario, and if national pledges under the Paris agreement are carried out this would decrease the warming more (though not meeting the two degree target).\\nEven Rob and Dave had a huge range of predictions for that very high scenario – anything from 30 cm sea level fall to nearly two metres rise – and they originally described their model as ‘speculative’. So it’s not justified to use such strong, certain phrases as ‘the destruction would be unstoppable’.\\nI was particularly concerned about some of the implied time scales and impacts. That ‘slowly burying every shoreline…creating hundreds of millions of climate refugees…could play out in a mere 20 to 50 years’ (it could begin then, but would take far longer). That ‘the full 11 feet’ could be unlocked by 2100 (Rob and Dave predicted the middle of next century). That cities will be ‘wiped off the map’ (we will adapt, because the costs of protecting coastlines are predicted to be far less than those of flooding). We absolutely should be concerned about climate risks, and reduce them. But black-and-white thinking and over-simplification don’t help with risk management, they hinder. \\nIs “the entire scientific community [in] emergency mode”? We are cautious, and trying to learn more. Climate prediction is a strange game. It takes decades to test our predictions, so society must make decisions with the best evidence but always under uncertainty. I understand why a US-based climate scientist would feel particularly pessimistic. But we have to take care not to talk about the apocalypse as if it were inevitable.',\n",
       " 'Modern conflict archaeology, the study of 20th and 21st century conflicts, is a new and slightly uncomfortable discipline in the world of archaeology. It’s problematic in a number of ways. Firstly, very little of it involves what most people would recognise as archaeology – digging up cultural material from the ground for study. Most of the material legacies of modern conflicts remain above ground and embedded in current society, necessitating a more anthropological, interdisciplinary approach. Secondly, the time periods under study are often within living memory, and often remain highly contentious within the affected regions. This means that modern conflict archaeology can be a political minefield – as well as an actual minefield.\\nI’m currently working in Iraq down in Basra province at the two thousand-year-old city of Charax Spasinou, founded by Alexander the Great in 324 BC. Thirty years ago, however, the site was home to thousands of Iraqi soldiers. The Iran-Iraq war was dragging towards its end, both sides exhausted by the waves of offensives which had made 1987 the war’s bloodiest year. That spring the Siege of Basra had cost the lives of at least 60,000 Iranian and 20,000 Iraqi soldiers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Map of the area around Basra showing the position of Charax Spasinou.

Illustration: Mary Shepperson/Google Earth\\n\\n\\nCharax Spasinou wasn’t the only archaeological site re-occupied during the eight-year conflict. The border area between Iran and Iraq is phenomenally rich in archaeology, and archaeological sites often made the best defensive positions – rising ground into which earthworks could be dug. There’s hardly an ancient tell in eastern Iraq that doesn’t have the remains of an artillery emplacement or observation post dug into the top of it. At Charax Spasinou it was the ancient city’s still imposing ramparts which led to the site being incorporated into the Iraqi defensive lines north of Basra.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDespite landmines, snakes and dodgy gin, Iraq is an archaeological paradise\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe surviving mudbrick ramparts on the northern and eastern sides of the city (conveniently the directions from which Iranian attacks were most likely) stand to a height of up to eight metres above the flat alluvial plain and run for almost 3.5km. When the Iraqi army arrived, engineers refortified Charax Spasinou for modern warfare. At least 45 gaps were punched through the upper level of the ancient walls, with ramps of debris on the inner side so that tanks and artillery could be embedded in the ramparts. Along the top of the ancient walls, infantry positions were dug into the mudbrick and connected by trenches running behind them along the reverse slope. At least 199 of these dugouts are still visible on the top of the ramparts, each big enough for between two and four men. In some areas the remains of sandbags can still be seen emerging from the silt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\nDrone video of the Parthian ramparts of Charax Spasinou.

In front of the walls and behind them the army used bulldozers to throw up berms, as well as digging auxiliary trenches and storage pits for equipment and ammunition. Hundreds of vehicles; tanks, APCs, fuel tankers and supply trucks, were stationed behind and around the walls of Charax. Each was protected by bulldozed banks of ancient archaeological deposits, usually heaped into a horseshoe shape to give protection on three sides and escape via the fourth. So far I’ve counted 212 such vehicle emplacements within the five square kilometres of the ancient city, not including the many more which are visible immediately outside the ramparts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Vehicle and artillery emplacements around, what Ali Wehayib tells me, was the central army camp at Charax Spasinou.

In every respect, the military legacy at Charax Spasinou represents an important phase of occupation at the site, as well as being the material record of significant historical events which had a profound impact on Iraq and the wider region. \\nWhen we consider military activity at archaeological sites, particularly those related to the recent and ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Syria, they are too often bewailed purely as damage to the archaeological record. While the use of archaeological sites as military positions is an unfortunate aspect of war, it’s important to remember that these activities are also the record of important historical and political events in a landscape which continues to be shaped by human occupation.\\nThe Charax Spasinou project is supported by the British Council’s Cultural protection fund, which is set up in partnership with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, and by the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities and Heritage.',\n",
       " 'OK, so most UK water companies have people who use divining rods to find leaks and burst pipes, although many have since back-pedalled on these admissions since the story broke, thanks to the sterling work of science writer Sally Le Page, who deserves all credit for it. Understandable perhaps; if you were a major utility provider earning millions by providing an essential resource to large populations, you’d probably be a bit embarrassed if people found out your highly-trained and expensive technicians were essentially using witchcraft to fix problems.\\nBut, the expense and professionalism aspects aside, is it really that bad? Aren’t people overreacting a bit? It’s not like they’re claiming they can cure cancer or speak to the dead or anything like that, effectively taking money from the grieving and desperate. So some technicians wander around a field waving twigs about in an effort to find a leak? Bit weird, but where’s the harm? There must be something to it, surely? So what’s the harm? \\nWell, there’s a lot of potential harm that could be easily avoided by water companies sticking to methods that have a basis in reality. \\nBut hold on, you may say, dowsing has been around for hundreds of years and, demonstrably, is still in use, so surely there must be something to it, right? In a way, maybe. The idea that you can walk around unremarkable ground with a rod or pair of rods which will dip or cross when you walk over underground water is an odd one. How would this even happen? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Water divining? Or a shootout with surprisingly skinny pistols? Either makes as much sense as the other. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo\\n\\n\\nSure, water is actually strange and weird stuff, despite how common it is to us humans, but the idea that a moderate volume of water can exert some form of hitherto undetectable field, one that can reach through several metres of solid ground to tweak a stick held by a passing human, is a bit of a stretch, surely? If this were the case then you’d expect your kitchen cutlery to end up pointing at the bath you’d just run upstairs. Thus far, there have been no reports of this happening. \\nMost scientists attribute the “effects” of dowsing to the ideomotor effect. There is a lot of complex science around how this works, but to put it simply, sometimes our brain tells our body to do something without us knowing. Don’t forget that there are many processes going on in our brains at any one time, most of which we’re blissfully unaware of on a conscious level. A lot of instinct, reflexes, basic housekeeping, and so on. And sometimes, regions are activated when they’re not “needed” to be, purely as a reactive measure. \\nYou see someone reacting with disgust, you experience activity in your own insula, the region which processes disgust perception. You think about eating something delicious, you start salivating. And you expect to find water in a certain place, the muscles in the arms and hands holding the finely-balanced rods that would reveal this twitch and tense slightly, enough to provide a “positive reaction”. \\nIt could be argued that professional water company engineers using dowsing rods are reacting to subconscious cues indicative of water underground; slightly softer surface, grass discolouration, maybe even moisture in the air? I don’t know, but perhaps it’s a wholly unconscious process. \\nHowever, this would still be massively vulnerable to expectations and suggestions; someone says “I think the leak is over there” and your rods cross at that point, because you expected them to. As a result, dowsing has never been reliably demonstrated under laboratory conditions. \\nStill, though. What’s the harm? So some technicians resort to more dubious methods to find leaks? They’re not hurting anyone, right? Well, maybe. But then, maybe not. Using dowsing to find leaks is little better than guesswork, and that means sometimes they’re bound to guess a leak is in the wrong place, leading to long and expensive efforts to dig up and expose an intact pipe, while the real leak is elsewhere, still merrily pumping out valuable water. \\nPeople need a regular water supply, it’s hard to imagine a modern life without it. Drinking water is most important of course, but consider all the household and industrial processes that depend on it, from washing machines to construction. Any delay will have considerable, expensive and potentially dangerous consequences. And that’s not to mention the damage being done to ground with the water leaking. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  “Keep back please, we’ve summoned a warlock to deal with it and he’s on his way” Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA\\n\\n\\nBut there are other consequences too, subtler but perhaps more pervasive overall. Imagine your house was burning down, and you called the fire brigade, only to have them turn up and, instead of unrolling their houses, they started performing a rain dance, to extinguish the flames. You’d likely be baffled at least, possibly rather alarmed and angry. Trained professionals in an emergency situation, trying to fix a problem with a method that, cultural and traditional aspects aside, has no logical hope of working? \\nAnd yet, that’s essentially what the water company engineers are doing. Arguably less pressing and elaborate, but the situation is the same. But, when people see trained professionals, ones they may well have summoned and are paying for, using these methods, what are they supposed to think? How we recognise expert credibility is a tricky and elaborate process, but it’s definitely there. \\nSo, you see someone you recognise as knowing more than you doing something you assumed to be nonsense, in a professional capacity, how do you resolve this dissonance? Either call your own judgement and decisions into doubt, which our brains really don’t like doing, or, conclude that maybe it’s not nonsense. And once you’ve done that with one thing, reasoned that what we’ve been told about science and logic isn’t necessarily correct, why stop there? Maybe the Earth is flat! Maybe Bigfoot does exist! Maybe your face will stay that way if the wind changes! And so on.\\nOK, so that’s maybe a bit excessive, but who knows? It’s 2017, nothing is certain any more. But in a world awash with misinformation and bogus beliefs taking precedence over established fact, we can ill afford more getting out there. We need to stop the leaks as soon as they happen. \\nDean Burnett covers other facets of how our brains betray us in his book The Idiot Brain, available now, in the UK and US and elsewhere.',\n",
       " 'The term alcoholism has long been retired from official alcohol clinical and policy guidance, abandoned as a reductionist and stigmatising label for problem drinking. Instead, alcohol use disorders, some including varying degrees of dependency, reflect the wider continuum nature of alcohol problems. Despite this, inappropriate references to “alcoholics” are ubiquitous in everyday narratives including mainstream media, undermining opportunities to reduce alcohol harms in a number of subtle ways.\\nOne reason for over use of the alcoholism concept may be a lack of a common language to describe the nuances of heavy drinking behaviours. Alcoholism may be assumed to be synonymous with alcohol dependence, but it is inherently bound to stereotypes of hitting rock bottom and beliefs in its nature as a lifelong disease. The media rarely offers alternative problem drinking accounts other than the equally flawed spectacle of binge drinking, and in turn perpetuates an overly simplistic framework for the public to reference their own beliefs and attitudes against. \\nAlcohol problems remain highly stigmatised, even compared to mental health issues, and so advocates of the disease model have long claimed that it removes the stigma of the addiction by shifting the blame from the person onto the illness itself or its mooted genetic roots. \\nBut the evidence for the disease model’s blame alleviation potential is mixed. Whilst some studies have shown that genetic or disease model beliefs do have some potential stigma related benefits, they have also been shown to increase fearfulness amongst the general public. Further studies show a complex and mixed picture towards alcoholism beliefs and its socio-cultural influences, but at their core disease beliefs create a separation between a healthy “us” and a diseased “them”, potentially even increasing outgroup stigma. Whilst admitting to having a problem with alcohol may often be regarded as the crucial step, for many it is the existence of stigma that acts a major barrier to doing so. Even people who find recovery through adopting an alcoholic identity can find the process a difficult and internally conflicting experience. \\nShifting perceptions away from the false binary of alcoholism and its inherent disease connotations has other important implications. From a public health perspective, the majority of England’s ten million drinkers at risk of alcohol-related harms are not addicted, at least not to the extent they would consider themselves as alcoholic. Even of the 1.6 million harmful drinkers, many do not consider their drinking as problematic, instead pointing to those with heavier consumption than their own. I see this “othering” as a valid form of denial; heavy drinkers often correctly assert that they are not alcoholics as they do not conform to stereotypical beliefs about alcoholics as dysfunctional and unable to exert any control over their drinking. This valid denial is facilitated by the culturally endorsed but artificial dividing line between alcoholics and everyone else. Whilst explanations for denial itself are also complex, the belief that only alcoholics need help undermines many heavy drinkers from contemplating change.\\nWhile there’s little research into this at present (though it’s currently the subject of my PhD research), other negative impacts of the disease model are better established. Self-efficacy is the belief in one’s own ability to make a change and is a key predictor of recovery amongst problem drinkers, yet is undermined by beliefs in alcoholism when compared to more nuanced “continuum” beliefs about drinking. \\nIn simple terms, alcoholism is typically conceived as genetic and pathological in its nature, thus perceived as uncontrollable and requiring treatment or lifelong Alcoholics Anonymous attendance. When we apply this set of beliefs and expectations to the many drinkers who do not identify with the dominant idea of alcoholism, we undermine both their chances to recognise their drinking as something worth changing, and their beliefs that it is within their control to do so. Over-application of the term reinforces the misconception that all alcohol problems are severe, occur in a genetically distinct population, and require formal abstinence only treatment and medication. \\nThe broad brush stroke of alcoholism appears all too often in public narratives. In 2015 when a controversial drug was made available with the aim of supporting harmful drinkers without severe dependency to cut down, headlines such as New £3 pill to ‘cure’ alcoholism can stop binge boozing were not uncommon. \\nIt is not just tabloid journalism either: the Guardian has its very own alcoholism tag under which the majority of features on dependency are personal accounts in line with disease model, reinforcing this othering of alcohol dependence problems. Earlier this year it published a piece titled Alcoholism continues long after you stop drinking but the content of the article emphasised the extreme complexity and damage problem drinking can involve, while containing nothing supporting the title’s disputed assertion. \\nEven articles attempting to dispel the us versus them narrative around alcoholism can miss the mark. Earlier this year the established journalist and author Nick Cohen shared an engaging and honest article about his drinking, but the narrative was again fundamentally flawed. Whilst declaring himself “not an alcoholic” and examining the questionable scientific validity of the disease model, Cohen repeatedly returns the reader to a conflated and inaccurate notion of alcoholism. Granted, an alternative language is lacking, but it is the job of good journalism to find ways to responsibly explore and articulate such complex issues.\\nHowever to approach all alcohol problems through the lens of alcoholism may be akin to labelling anyone experiencing a period of low mood as clinically depressed. Whenever we choose the language of alcoholism outside of specific recovery contexts, we tar those people with assumptions that may have counter-productive effects. In turn, we reify a false separation between so-called alcoholics and everyone else, enabling othering and driving stigma. Sections of the media should lead the way in resisting the temptation to always reach for the over familiar and too often myopic alcoholic narrative.\\nJames Morris is a PhD student at London South Bank University.

       " \"We don’t generally think of chickens and ducks as particularly awe-inspiring birds. Kept across the world as pets or as a food source, chickens (Galliformes) and ducks and geese (Anseriformes) are ubiquitous and seen as docile and unintimidating. The comparative anatomist Thomas Huxley noted in 1867 that Galliformes and Anseriformes shared a number of anatomical features, suggesting that the two groups of birds must be related. Later morphological and molecular studies confirmed their close relationship, and all fowl are now grouped in Galloanserae. Galloanserae are considered one of the most primitive groups of modern birds, and their ancestry can be traced back to the time of the dinosaurs. In contrast to their cuddly modern cousins, early fowl were truly giants by avian measures, and included the largest birds on Earth during the Paleogene.\\nThere are several groups of enormous, extinct terrestrial birds that are considered part of Galloanserae. One of them is the Dromornithidae, or Thunderbirds, from Australia. These giant flightless birds lived from the Oligocene until the Pleistocene and formed part of Australia’s megafauna (Worthy & Holdaway, 2002). Some dromornithids reached colossal size, such as Bullockornis, nicknamed the Demon Duck of Doom, which likely stood 2.5 metres tall. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlightless bird with giant head roamed swampy Arctic 53m years ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAcross Eurasia, the giant bird niche was taken by the Gastornithidae, which ranged from the Paleocene to the Eocene. Three species of these large, flightless birds with strong legs and massive beaks are known from Europe. A species from North America, formerly known as Diatryma gigantea, is now considered to be the fourth species of Gastornithidae. With their giant beak and powerful legs, a peculiar anatomy amongst birds, Gastornithidae were long considered to be carnivores, possibly preying on contemporaneous small horses (Witmer & Rose, 1991). However, as the beaks lack hooks typical for carnivorous birds, and calcium isotopes in the bones do not support a meat-based diet (Angst et al., 2014), it is now assumed that gastornithids were herbivores.\\nDisentangling the relationships of animals that lived 30m years ago, and of which sometimes only fragmentary skeletons remain, is challenging. What makes things even more complicated in the case of these colossal birds is that they all display massive hind limbs and reduced wings. On first glance, this aligns them with other groups that show this prominent morphology, such as the elephant birds from Madagascar, the moa from New Zealand and the modern-day ratites (ostriches, emus and allies). And indeed, for a long time, Dromornithidae were considered to be closely related to ratites (for instance, Rich, 1979). However, closer examination of the skulls of dromornithidae showed that they were not part of ratites after all. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  A mounted skeleton of\\nGastornis showing the massive beak and hind limbs. Photograph: By F. Lucas. [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons\\n\\n\\nBut where did these behemoths belong? Studies based on morphological datasets of the whole skeleton subsequently placed Dromornithidae, as well as Gastornithidae, as sister groups to Anseriformes (Andors, 1992; Agnolin, 2007), whereas others (Murray & Vickers-Rich, 2004) found that Dromornithidae were part of Anseriformes. It has also been suggested that Dromornithidae, together with the Sylviornithidae from New Caledonia, are sister groups to Galloanserae as a whole (Mayr, 2011). And then there is the case of the South American terrorbirds (Phorusracidae), another group of enormous, terrestrial birds with heavy bills who in certain analyses are placed within Anseriformes (Degrange et al., 2015). \\nAlthough it is now clear that Dromornithidae, Gastornithidae and Sylviornithidae are close to Galloanserae, their exact positions with regard to this group remains unclear. Are they in, or are they out? Resolving the classification of these giant birds is plagued by their convergent morphologies, in this case the massive hind limbs and reduced wings, and often limited sampling of potentially related species. Morphological convergence reflects an adaption to a shared environment rather than a feature derived from a common ancestor. For instance, the elongated set of tail vertebrae in in different groups of diving birds suggests that this morphology is related to the mechanical demands of using the tail as a rudder during underwater foraging (Felice & O’Connor, 2014), rather than common descent.\\nGrouping species based on morphology when there is a strong suspicion of convergence can result in flawed results. With the rise of molecular phylogenetics, pioneered by Sibley and Ahlquist in 1990, ornithologists have successfully used DNA analyses to resolve bird relationships. Although molecular phylogenetics definitely has its caveats, molecular data have now provided a robust phylogenetic tree for living bird species (for instance, Hackett et al., 2008). These trees are often rather different from those derived from morphological data only, often because of cases of convergence. As convergent morphologies have been the thorn in the side of the avian palaeontologist on a quest to solve the relationships between extinct giant flightless birds and living Galloanserae, Australian bird palaeontologist Trevor Worthy and his team set out to resolve this issue once and for all by combining molecular and morphological data.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  The most parsimonous tree of the relationships between extinct and living Galloanserae retrieved by Worthy et al’s analyses. Body size is shown by circle size, flight ability by circle shading and diet is indicated by branch colour Illustration: Worthy et al., 2017. Royal Society Open Science\\n\\n\\nWorthy and colleagues collated a large dataset of 290 morphological features for 20 extinct giant flightless birds and 29 living birds. These morphological data were analyzed against a molecular framework that constrained the relationships of the living birds to the relationships that are robustly inferred from molecular data. The data from the fossil birds were then free to find their place on the bird tree as dictated by their morphological similarities to the living species already in place. By constraining the analyses of the fossil taxa in this way, the fossil species are analyzed in the context of a evolutionary framework that, at this point, is the best reconstruction of the evolutionary tree of birds we have, while at the same time also considering the morphology of all skeletal parts. \\nThe analyses showed the presence of four distinct groups within early Galloanserae; Anseriformes, Galliformes, a group formed by Gastornithidae and Dromornithidae together (named Gastornithiformes), and Vegavis (the earliest member of Gallaoanserae dated to 69-66 million years ago, Clark et al., 2016). The Sylviornithidae were found to be part of Galliformes. Phorusrhacidae, the enormous flightless birds from South America, were found to be well outside of Galloanserae and thus unrelated to Dromornithidae and Gastornithidae, as they may be closer to seriemas. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho killed off Australia's big birds?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis means that dromornithids are not inside of Anseriformes, but form a separate sister group to fowl, together with the Gastornithidae. Does this mean that the ancestor of chickens and ducks was a large and flightless bird? No. As with ratites, where a volant ancestor repeatedly gave rise to parallel lineages of flightless birds, a small volant early galloansere bird spawned the various species of gastornithids and dromornithids, who subsequently lost the ability to fly. The current new analysis reconstructs the diet of ancestral Galloanserae as herbivorous or mainly herbivorous diet. This suggests that gastornithids, dromornithids and sylviornithids retained a similar diet, despite an almost 100-fold increases in body mass and considerable morphological change. \\nReferences\\nAgnolin, F.L., 2007 Brontornis burmeisteri Moreno & Mercerat, un Anseriformes (Aves) gigante del Mioceno Medio de Patagonia, Argentina.

Chocolate bars are shrinking, sugary drinks are set to be taxed and our recommended daily sugar intake has been slashed in half. But the battle against sugar might have begun sooner if the industry hadn’t kept secrets to protect its commercial interests, according to new findings. \\n In 1967, when scientists were arguing over the link between sugar consumption and increased risk of heart disease, researchers now claim that the International Sugar Research Foundation (ISRF) withheld findings that rats that were fed a high-sugar diet had higher levels of triglycerides (a fat found in the blood) than those fed starch. In a move researchers from the University of California at San Francisco have compared to the tobacco industry’s self-preservation tactics, the foundation stopped funding the project.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSugar lobby paid scientists to blur sugar's role in heart disease – report\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCristin Kearns, one of the researchers who analysed ISRF documents, says, “ISRF’s research was designed to cast doubt on the importance of elevated triglycerides in the blood as a heart disease risk factor. It is now commonly accepted that triglycerides are a risk factor, but this was controversial for decades. I think the scientific community would have come to consensus about elevated triglycerides being a risk factor for heart disease much sooner [if the research been published].”\\nA year later the foundation funded Project 259, looking into the effects of sucrose consumption in the intestinal tracts of rats. It found a possible link between sugar consumption and increased risk of bladder cancer, and described the findings as “one of the first demonstrations of a biological difference between sucrose and starch fed rats”. But the ISRF terminated the project’s funding before the experiments were finished, despite the study having already lasted 27 months, and requiring only three more months.\\nThe study, the researchers argue in their new paper, published in the journal Plos Biology, could possibly have had implications for humans, and indicates how ISRF downplayed sugar’s role in cardiovascular disease due to commercial interests.\\nKearns says, “ISRF’s primary purpose was, and still is as the Sugar Association and the World Sugar Research Organisation, to sell more sucrose.

However, those given a placebo also saw benefits, with 26.6% of participants in this group experiencing such a reduction.\\nLead investigator Prof Peter Goadsby, from King’s College hospital, London, said: “Strive … represents an incredibly important step forward for migraine understanding and migraine treatment.” \\nThe findings, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, clearly showed that blocking the CGRP pathway could reduce the impact of migraine, he said. “The results of Strive represent a real transition for migraine patients from poorly understood, re-purposed treatments, to a specific migraine-designed therapy.”\\nSimon Evans, chief executive of the charity Migraine Action, said: “Migraine is too often trivialised as just a headache when, in reality, it can be a debilitating, chronic condition that can destroy lives. The effects can last for hours, even days in many cases.\\n“An option that can prevent migraine and that is well tolerated is therefore sorely needed, and we hope that this marks the start of real change in how this condition is treated and perceived.” \\n“Broadly speaking I think this is a very interesting study and I think it is a good step forward for the field and I think it is a good day for migraine sufferers,” said professor Zameel Cader, Director of the Oxford Headache Centre who was not involved in the research, pointing out that the results were on a par with currently available therapies for migraine.\\n“Placebo responses [in migraine studies] are quite high and I think that is partly due to the subjective nature of pain and because of the strong psychological effects that being treated have on that experience of pain and those symptoms,” he said, adding that injections generally result in an even stronger placebo effect than tablets.\\nCader said that he too was looking at running trials using antibodies, and said he was excited about the approach since it might result in fewer side effects than current therapies, and would mean individuals would not have to remember to take a table every day.\\n“This is probably the first example of a migraine preventing drug that was rationally designed, rather than serendipitously found,” he added. \\nAmgen and Novartis, the codevelopers of erenumab, funded the trial, while Amgen also supplied the drug and conducted the data analyses.',\n",

       " 'Matt Bowden, 34, works in the textiles industry. He is from Durham, UK and currently living in Taipei, Taiwan\\nI came across Robert Macfarlane’s article Generation Anthropocene: how humans have altered the planet forever, as part of my MA course last year. It was recommended reading and ignited a deep interest in humans’ impact on the planet, and an impetus to reimagine my relationship with the environment.\\nMacfarlane explains the term “Anthropocene” as “the new epoch of geological time in which human activity is considered such a powerful influence on the environment, climate and ecology of the planet that it will leave a long-term signature in the strata record”. Many scientists argue that it began in 1950 and continues today. This concept really intrigued me and sparked a fascination that has grown and grown.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Matt Bowden Photograph: Handout\\n\\n\\nI studied Chinese and politics for my first degree, having always had a passion for literature and linguistics, and I have been in Asia since I graduated in 2005. In 2012 I moved to Taiwan, where I work for a company that produces knitwear for the US market. I enjoy my work, but a few years into my career I decided I wanted to do something extracurricular that was stimulating and challenging. \\nSo in 2015, I embarked on a distance programme with Nottingham University, studying towards an MA in English Studies with a special focus on ecocriticism – the examination of how nature is portrayed using the written word, and how this portrayal influences human behaviour. It’s a really fascinating area of study, and one about which Macfarlane is hugely knowledgeable.\\nI was introduced to his work during my course, when we were asked to read his book The Wild Places. It had a big impact on me, and I started to read more of his work: Landmarks, an exploration of the language we use to describe nature; Mountains of the Mind, about humans’ fascination with mountains; and soon articles such as this one in the Guardian. This particular piece made a huge splash among environmental academics, but its appearance in a popular newspaper also brought it to the forefront of public consciousness. It struck a chord with me in a way that other literature on climate change had not. \\nWe are living in an epoch defined by nuclear tests and plastic pollution, and having the right terminology to describe this unique, and uniquely horrifying, time feels important. Macfarlane reminds us in no uncertain terms that “among the future fossils of the Anthropocene might be … shampoo bottles and deodorant caps”, combining clear expertise and a rich array of cultural references with a style of writing that is detailed and extremely evocative. Once I had read this piece, it was impossible to unread.\\nAlmost like the Anthropocene age itself, it “administered – and will administer – a massive jolt to the imagination”. I immediately shared it with friends and family, made its theme the major focus of my thesis, and began to make changes to my life. \\nTaiwan has a very throwaway culture, so I began using my own flask when buying coffee, and using metal chopsticks in restaurants instead of disposable ones. I did make some bigger changes too – my family live in the UK and I would like to spend more time with them, but I’m acutely aware of the environmental impact of flying, so now try to do so as little as possible. I surf quite a bit in my spare time, so have helped out with beach cleanups – the beaches in this part of the world have a huge problem with litter. \\nBut we are living through a cataclysmic environmental crisis, and these relatively small changes will not be sufficient to improve matters unless they occur on a global scale. \\nIt can sometimes seem overwhelming to consider how to tackle the present situation but there is cause for optimism if we work together. In the time since completing my course I have got married and become a dad, and thinking about the planet we will bequeath to the next generation feels more pressing than ever.\\n\\nTell us about the article that made you think differently, or inspired you to do something you might not have considered.

       " \"After eluding scholars for decades, a copy of On the Origin of Species with handwritten revisions by Charles Darwin has come to light and is due to be auctioned next month.\\nChristie’s has put an estimate of £300,000 to £500,000 on the annotated book, which it said will allow “for the first time a precise reading of Darwin’s exact revisions without the veil of reconstruction and translation … [it] provides an insight into his working method, and documents the further development of his ideas for his ‘big book’.”\\nDarwin’s changes were made on a complete set of loose sheets from the third edition of his masterpiece, which he sent to his German translator for inclusion in the second German edition of On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. The alterations were then incorporated into the fourth English edition and all subsequent versions of the book, meaning they remain the definitive text of the seminal scientific work.\\nAccording to the auction house, the annotated sheets are thought to have been in the possession of the translator, HG Bronn, when he died in 1862. They were subsequently bound, and entered the possession of Darwin’s correspondent, the German palaeontologist Melchior Neumayr. The volume has been in the hands of Neumayr’s descendants until now.\\nScholars have known from Darwin’s correspondence that the annotations existed. In March 1862 he wrote, “I should like to make a few more corrections on clean sheets of the last English Edition”, adding in the next month: “I have compared the sheets of the Third English Edition with the Second which was translated into German, & have marked with a pencil line all the additions & corrections … Where merely a few words have been altered I have underlined them with pencil: where a sentence has to be omitted I have marked ‘dele’.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Some of Charles Darwin’s annotations to On the Origin of Species. Photograph: Christie's\\n\\n\\nBut Christie’s, which is including a letter from Darwin to Neumayr in the lot, said that “their whereabouts and even survival has remained a mystery”.\\nChristie’s specialist Meg Ford said the revisions made to the text “reflect[ed] Darwin’s ongoing refinement of his scientific research and thinking”. One, in chapter 13, on classification, “encapsulates a discovery Darwin made while working on his book on Orchids in 1861-62, that is, exactly at the time Darwin was marking up these printed sheets to send to Bronn”.\\nThe third edition reads: “As soon as three Orchidean forms (Monachanthus, Myanthus, and Catasetum), which had previously been ranked as three distinct genera, were known to be sometimes produced on the same spike, they were immediately included.” Darwin adds in the margin: “as remarkable variations under the same species; but [I] have recently been enabled to show that they constitute the female, hermaphrodite & male forms of the same orchid.”\\nFord said: “His work on orchids relates to his evolutionary theories by showing that orchids evolved to allow cross-fertilisation in a single plant. He is incorporating his own research (as well as that of others elsewhere), in his own hand.”\\nAccording to Christie’s, which sold a first edition of On the Origin of Species, with no annotations, for £269,000 last July, while individual pages of autograph drafts from the book “very occasionally” appear on the market, “no other example of Darwin’s autograph revisions to the text are known to have been offered”.\\n“Annotated copies by him are incredibly rare,” said Ford. “This one really shows him engaging with his text … To have his own thoughts on a text that we know occupied him fully right up until his death is really just remarkable. This physical manifestation of a great scientist grappling with his great work is extraordinary, both in terms of its rarity, and the physical evidence of it.”\",\n",
       " 'The UK’s drug guidelines body is recommending a type of medication to treat chronic kidney disease despite no firm evidence that it benefits patients – and some signs that the drugs may do more harm than good, experts have warned.\\nPhosphate binders are commonly prescribed to lower blood phosphate levels in patients with advanced kidney disease, including those on dialysis. High phosphate has been linked to worse patient outcomes, including bone and muscle problems, a build-up of calcium in the blood vessels causing them to stiffen, and an increased death rate.\\nExperts say current recommendations by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which advocate the use of phosphate binders, are based on little evidence that they benefit patients.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCancer Drugs Fund condemned as expensive and ineffective\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No one has ever shown that reducing [phosphate levels], in a trial, actually improves the wellbeing of the patients,” said Prof Phil Kalra, the national specialty lead for renal disorders at the National Institute for Health Research, pointing out that high phosphate levels might simply be a marker of other problems.\\nMoreover, there are concerns that calcium-based phosphate binders – which are the cheapest option and are recommended by Nice as the “first line” drugs – could do more harm than good. Research suggests that they could worsen the build-up of calcium in blood vessels, linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\\nAccording to NHS data seen by the Guardian, and backed up by figures available online, more than 167,000 prescription items for phosphate binders were dispensed in community in England in 2016 alone, amounting to a total cost of £9,442,845.86. Almost 70,000 of these were calcium-based.\\n“There are many of us who believe that there should be a trial to actually see if lowering phosphate per se, by whatever means, benefits the patient,” said Kalra, adding that studies should also consider the different types of drug. “There is a risk here [that] by thinking we still need to treat phosphate, and by following the Nice guidance, we may be doing more harm to some patients than if we left them alone,” he said, although Kalra stressed that patients currently taking such drugs should not stop their medication.\\nNewly updated guidelines from the global non-profit kidney foundation Kidney Disease – Improving Global Outcomes (Kdigo) reflect the lack of evidence, acknowledging there have not been enough trials on phosphate binders to make firm recommendations for their use. Instead, the team merely “suggest” that elevated phosphate levels be lowered, whether by diet or drugs, and similarly urge that the use of calcium-based phosphate binders be restricted.\\nDavid Wheeler, professor of kidney medicine at University College London and co-chair of Kdigo, said he did not think Nice’s recommendation of calcium-based phosphate binders as the first-line drug was based on evidence.\\n“My own view is that if non-calcium based binders were as cheap as calcium based binders, we would only be using non-calcium based binders,” he said.\\nBut, Wheeler added, while non-calcium based phosphate binders are less likely to cause problems of calcium build-up in blood vessels, even for these drugs there is a dearth of evidence that they improve patient outcomes, and that clinical trials comparing the different types of drug with each other, and with a placebo, were crucial.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinance trumps patients at every level – UK healthcare needs an inquiry | Aseem Malhotra\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think there is an urgent need to address these questions,” he said, adding that trials to tackle the issues had suffered from a lack of funding.\\nDr Richard Haynes, a consultant at Stoke Mandeville Renal Unit, agreed. “The short answer is no, we don’t have a robust evidence base at all to support what we are doing in terms of what the guidelines currently say,” he said. “The worst case scenario is that we are trying to intervene on something which is not important and by doing so we are causing harm,” he added. “There is no evidence to say that is definitely what is happening at the moment, but it does make me cautious.”\\nDr Sankar Navaneethan, a co-author of a 2011 Cochrane review into phosphate binders, said that at least on the surface, the use of such drugs made sense: “The main biochemical marker that has been consistently associated with cardiovascular disease and mortality is serum phosphorus.”. However, he agreed that clinical trials were needed to explore whether the drugs do indeed benefit patients, but added that such trials might be hindered by ethical concerns – particularly for patients on dialysis.\\nCommenting on the current guidelines, a Nice spokesperson said: “In light of the available evidence the independent guideline committee on chronic kidney disease felt that, on balance, a recommendation for phosphate binders was more likely to have a beneficial effect than not.”\\nBut, they added, Nice is currently in the process of reviewing the latest evidence for people with late stage chronic kidney disease, including those on dialysis, to explore whether phosphate binders are effective.',\n",
       " 'Adults are spending an increasing number of their retirement years in poor health, a thinktank on ageing and population has warned.\\nThe report, which focuses on the situation facing those approaching retirement, also highlights the growing inequalities in life expectancy around the country. \\n“We need to start having very frank discussions about what social care is going to look like, what healthcare is going to look like, what taxation is going to look like, what labour and immigration policies are going look like – and all of this needs to be set against the context of an ageing society,” says Dean Hochlaf, a co-author of the report from the International Longevity Centre.\\nThe report also flags up that the number of years one can expect to be healthy varies dramatically by location: while 65-year-olds in the London borough of Tower Hamlets have just 6.5 years of healthy life expectancy ahead of them, those in the more affluent borough of Richmond can expect 14.5 years. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdult social care is in crisis mode.

Indeed, more than a quarter of zero-hours work is undertaken by the over-50s.\\n“If older workers want to participate in the flexible labour market, and if they can benefit from it, it’s a good thing – but we also have to make sure that they are recognised as a major component of this new sort of gig economy, ” said Hochlaf. \\nWhile the majority of those aged 55-64 own their own homes without a mortgage, the report shows that in recent years there has been an uptick in private renting, with almost 12% of the age group renting their home in 2015/16 – up from 4.1% in 2003/04.\\nSarah Harper, professor of gerontology at the University of Oxford, said that the report highlights that pensioners were far from entering an age of rest. “Actually, people are still in the labour market, they are doing large amounts of caring not only for grandchildren but for other other adults, so it is actually for many people a time of activity still,” she said.\\nBut Harper cautioned it is difficult to measure healthy life expectancy, and flagged the large geographical variations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCentenarians are fastest growing age group in UK, figures show\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“The evidence seems to be that we are pushing back the onset of disability and therefore if anything we can expect people in their 60s and even early 70s probably to have better health and therefore to be able to keep active for longer,” she said. However, she noted that evidence also suggests an increase in time spent living with disability among the oldest members of the population.\\nDebora Price, professor of social gerontology at the University of Manchester, expressed concern at the findings. “We can see inequalities increasing, and that for many people this is a very tough period of life,” she said. \\n“We know that many older people live with very low incomes, poor housing, long-standing disabilities, high risks of social isolation and loneliness, and little power to change things,” she added. “This is very starkly shown in the report by the differences by local authority … these inequalities go across the life-course and are reflecting a really unequal society at all ages.”\\nSimon Bottery of the health charity the King’s Fund pointed out that changes in the fertility rate mean older people are likely to have fewer children to offer support.\\n“Overall, you are faced, I think, with this very clear picture of increasing care and support needs and a real difficulty in identifying who is going to provide it and who is going to pay for it.”',\n",

Hyde said that he and Pestana, while preparing for the show, had met many people who were anxious about what could lie ahead. “They feel like the future is something being done to them rather than it being something they are part of. Ultimately what we are hoping to show is that the future is still up for grabs.”\\nOne man who is proactively addressing his own future is the Oxford academic Anders Sandberg who is lending his cryonics alert bracelet to the exhibition.

       " 'Michael Gove has promised to make “any necessary changes” to UK law to recognise that animals can feel pain, after a social media campaign accused Conservative MPs of voting down proposals to accept they are sentient beings.\\nThe environment secretary issued a statement to the House of Commons insisting that it was a misconception to say Tory MPs voted against the idea that animals are sentient and feel pain.\\nBut he clarified that the government was now looking at making UK law specifically recognise animal sentience, following a row over the issue in the EU withdrawal bill.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMPs hog social media as they deny voting animals are not sentient\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“The prime minister has made clear that we will strengthen our animal welfare rules,” he said in in a written statement to MPs. “This government will ensure that any necessary changes required to UK law are made in a rigorous and comprehensive way to ensure animal sentience is recognised after we leave the EU.\\n“The withdrawal bill is not the right place to address this; however, we are considering the right legislative vehicle.”\\nGove also hinted that the UK could pursue tougher animal welfare rules after Brexit, including a ban on live animal exports and crackdown on puppy smuggling. He claimed EU rules currently prevented the government from imposing such restrictions.\\nThe furore erupted after the government rejected an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill from Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, which would have transposed a part of the Lisbon treaty into UK law to explicitly recognise that animals were sentient lifeforms. \\nMinisters insisted animals were protected under the Animal Welfare Act, which does not specifically mention sentience, but contains safeguards regarding animals in distress.\\nBut Gove was forced to act after social media campaigns by 38 Degrees, Compassion in World Farming, and other groups targeted Conservative MPs, calling on them to reverse their vote against recognising animal sentience.\\nIn his statement, the environment secretary claimed the EU instrument that Lucas wanted to transpose “does not have direct effect in law –[and] in practice its effect is very unclear and it has failed to prevent practices across the EU which are cruel and painful to animals”.\\n\\n\\n Quick guide What is the EU withdrawal bill?  \\n\\n\\n Show \\n\\n\\n Hide  \\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the EU withdrawal bill?\\n\\nThe EU Withdrawal Bill – once known as the Great Repeal Bill – is going through the House of Commons to repeal the 1972 European Communities Act and transpose all existing EU legislation into domestic UK law, which will avoid a \\'cliff-edge\\' change on the day after we leave the EU.\\xa0\\nParts of the bill have been highly controversial, and MPs have tabled hundreds of amendments to try and change its wording, including a significant number of Conservative rebels. Some of the key controversies include its use of so-called Henry VIII powers, which will give government ministers the power to tweak the wording of laws to make sure they make sense in UK legislation - but those changes could take place without having to go through parliament. MPs have called this a \"power grab\" by the government. The government estimates around 800 to 1,000 measures called statutory instruments will be required to make sure the bill is applied correctly.\\xa0\\nOther concerns include the government\\'s decision not to include the EU charter of fundamental rights in the law being transposed. Other amendments are attempts to affect the Brexit process, including legislating for a transitional period and giving MPs a binding meaningful vote on the deal secured by Theresa May, before the deal is finalised.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWas this helpful?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for your feedback.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, Lucas was not satisfied by Gove’s statement, saying it was “silly”. She tweeted it was “amazing to see so many animal lovers taking action in support of my animal sentience amendment”.\\n“If the EU withdrawal bill isn’t the right place to transfer EU law into UK law, then what is?” she said.\\nLucas added: “The government’s refusal to accept this amendment is simply absurd - and their continued insistence that sentience is covered in animal legislation is wrong. Britain been forward thinking animal welfare over the years, which is why ditching this provision would be such a backwards step. The UK government led on introducing this EU protocol in the first place, and it’s only an obsession with refusing changes to the EU withdrawal bill that’s stopping ministers adopting this amendment now.\\n “The animal sentience protocol is important because it is an instruction to future governments when creating legislation - and it should be the basis of future lawmaking on animal welfare in Britain.”\\nSince the debate, Conservative MPs have been bombarded with emails and social media activity criticising their presumed belief that animals are not sentient.\\nZac Goldsmith, the environmentally minded MP for Richmond Park, tweeted that some of the reporting had been “weird and dishonest”, and argued the vote had been about the correct legal procedure for ensuring animal welfare standards, not on the principle of whether animals are sentient.\\nFellow Conservative Rachel Maclean, the MP for Redditch, branded the campaigns “fake news”, stating that: “This government, and in fact all governments, are deeply committed to continuing to protect animals as sentient beings. That law is already written into our own law.”\\nCampaign groups have urged MPs to support other chances to amend the EU withdrawal bill to ensure animal sentience is recognised later in the passage of the legislation, which will create a further headache for the government.\\nThe Conservatives were taken by surprise during the election at the scale and depth of feeling about animal rights issues, after the party said it would hold a free vote on foxhunting and did not include promises about banning ivory sales in its manifesto. The government has since dropped the idea of reopening the foxhunting debate and banned the ivory trade, regardless of the age of items.',\n",

But light pollution is almost certainly on the rise in those countries given this elusive blue light, according to Christopher Kyba of the GFZ German research centre for geosciences and the lead author of the study published in Science Advances.\\nAlso on the rise is the spread of light into the hinterlands and overall increased use. The findings shatter the long-held notion that more energy-efficient lighting would decrease usage on the global – or at least a national – scale.\\n“Honestly, I had thought and assumed and hoped that with LEDs we were turning the corner. There’s also a lot more awareness of light pollution,” Kyba told reporters by phone from Potsdam. “It is quite disappointing.”\\nThe biological impact from surging artificial light is also significant, according to the researchers.\\nPeople’s sleep can be marred, which in turn can affect their health.

Just beneath the topsoil are gravel layers laid down by the river Thames as it flowed across central Essex 600,000 years ago. Under the gravels is the Red Crag: a rust-coloured, iron-rich, sandy layer that is 2.1m-3.6m years old (late Pilocene to early Pleistocene). Laid down by a cool sea, this deposit is rich in marine fossils, as can be seen a metre or two from the main path bordering the beach. \\nBivalve and gastropod shells stained by the iron protrude from the grains. The first one I encounter is a dog cockle or Glycymeris clam: a flattish, almost perfectly round bivalve up to 6cm across. Modern species of Glycymeris are eaten in several European countries. I find several early Pilocene specimens, one with a neat, round hole in its pointed end made by a predatory whelk drilling into its shell and eating it alive. \\nAt the base of the cliffs is a soft, dark older layer: the London Clay formation, dating back to the Lower Eocene, 49m-56m years ago.

When your kidneys do not work properly, dangerous levels of chemicals like potassium or phosphate can build up in your body. People who have kidney disease are usually given dietary advice as to how to help restrict their intake alongside medicines that bind these chemicals so that they can be excreted; and there is clear evidence that phosphate binders reduce levels of phosphate. Diet alone is not usually enough to reduce these levels, so medicines to help do this are important as without them levels could become too high and result in an increased chance of death.\\nNobody should stop taking their medicines after reading this article. If any of your readers are concerned then they need to speak to their doctor about the best ways to reduce phosphate in their diet in combination with taking the right phosphate binder for them and if they should swap to a calcium-free version.

       " 'My father, Alan Eddy, who has died aged 90, was the founding professor of biochemistry at Umist - the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology – where he carried out groundbreaking work with yeast. He was appointed professor and head of the department of biochemistry in 1959, and was in the vanguard of Umist’s transformation into a leading university.\\nBorn in St Just, Cornwall, Alan was the son of Ellen (nee Berryman) and Alfred Eddy. His mother was a teacher; his father worked as an assayer (working out how much metal there was in rocks) in the local tin mines and later, after qualifying as an accountant, as a salesman for the Burroughs Adding Machine company. Alan showed early academic promise, winning a scholarship to Devonport high school and then an open scholarship to Exeter College, Oxford, to study chemistry. At Oxford he rowed for the college and, as a member of the athletics club, trained with Roger Bannister.\\nGraduating with a first in 1949, Alan was awarded a DPhil in 1951. He remained at Oxford as an ICI fellow, under the Nobel prizewinner Sir Cyril Hinshelwood. For Alan’s DPhil project, he chose yeast and it remained his principal experimental organism for the rest of his career. He joined the Brewing Industry Research Foundation (BRF) in 1953, where he cut a dashing figure commuting on his 500cc motorbike.\\nWhile at the BRF, Alan and a colleague, Don Williamson, developed a technique that used snails’ gut juice to digest away tough yeast cell walls to produce what are known as protoplasts. This technical advance had enormous consequences. Early techniques to engineer yeast with recombinant DNA exploited protoplasts, and protoplasting also enabled the isolation of the membrane-bound compartments of the yeast cells. This opened the way for yeast to become the leading model for molecular cell biology, with seven 21st-century Nobel prize recipients having worked with the organism.\\nAt Umist, Alan pioneered the study of how molecules are transported into cells across the plasma membrane. He was one of the first people to understand, and promote, Peter Mitchell’s chemiosmotic hypothesis, which proposed an explanation of how cells use the energy from sources such as food and sunlight to make the compound (ATP) that powers them.\\nAlan led and nurtured a thriving department comprising 35 academics, many with international reputations. From the late 1960s he contributed to the Open University, in a series of broadcast lectures. Despite retiring in 1994, he continued to publish and to conduct laboratory research supported by a grant until 2012.\\nHe was widely read and his interests were reflected in a home filled with books. He travelled extensively but maintained a lifelong love of Cornwall, the Peak District and France.\\nIn 1954 Alan married Susan Slade-Jones. She survives him along with two sons, Phin and me, four grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.',\n",

However, extreme solar events may cause real problems down here. Giant, once-a-century solar storms are a known threat to power grids, but aircraft may be at risk from far more frequent events according to a new study of data from a neutron storm in February 1956.\\nThere is a steady background drizzle of neutrons, but when a large solar flare strikes the Earth’s atmosphere it can produce a cloudburst of them. We are shielded from most of the neutrons by the atmosphere, but radiation is more intense the higher you go. During the event in 1956, monitors showed 50 times the base level of neutrons at sea level. Airliners at the time mainly flew below 20,000 feet and were at little risk. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSolar spacecraft: two missions to the sun - Science Weekly podcast\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClive Dyer, of University of Surrey Space Centre, one of the report’s authors, says modern airliners, which cruise at twice the altitude of the earlier aircraft, would be exposed to 15 times as much radiation. A neutron storm like the event in 1956 would expose passengers to radiation equivalent to the annual working limit for air crews, and could also cause critical flight electronics to fail.\\nSuch storms occur in clusters, and Dyer warns they can occur as often as seven times a century. A warning system could direct planes to fly at lower altitudes to avoid dangerous neutron showers.',\n",

He dedicated his life’s work to building pioneering institutions that advocated the intelligent and innovative use of science and technology for a sustainable and equitable world. His influence came to span the globe, and his kindness and enthusiasm were felt by a vast network of colleagues and friends.\\nSon of Evelyn (nee Brooke) and Herbert Oldham, Geoff was born in Harden, West Yorkshire, where his father was a manager with the NatWest bank. He went to Bingley grammar and studied geology at the University of Reading. He was accepted for further studies at both Cambridge and Toronto universities; 10 days after his wedding in September 1951 to Brenda Raven, they sailed for Canada.\\nHaving obtained a PhD in geophysics from the University of Toronto, Geoff worked in oil company exploration, focusing on South America. Yet, he began to think about achieving something different as a scientist: helping to harness the world’s science and technology more effectively to eliminate the depths of poverty he had observed in Latin America. This led to a career change, via a period of research about science and technology in China and other Asian countries.\\nAs deputy director of the SPRU from 1966 and as its director from 1982 to 1992, he pushed forward policy research about science and technology in developing countries. In contrast to prevailing practices, which relied mainly on the transfer of technology and science from rich countries, Geoff argued that much greater emphasis should be placed on enhancing the capacity of developing countries to create their own. This was revolutionary at the time.\\nGeoff also played a pivotal role in 1970 in setting up what has been called the “jewel in the crown of Canadian aid”, the International Development Research Centre of Canada (IDRC). He then spearheaded its science and technology policy programme, fostering the development of policy research across Asia, Africa and Latin America. In 1990, he was appointed CBE for services to science.\\nAfter his tenure as SPRU director, Geoff continued in numerous advisory roles – in particular with high-level UN bodies, with the IDRC in Canada and with ministers of science and technology in China.

       " 'We joined the green-gowned brain surgery team soon after daybreak. The chill of the operating theatre was filled with the inevitable frisson of nerves before a big op. Inside the Orlika Street children’s hospital in the suburbs of Lviv, on the western edge of Ukraine, the patient was waiting for us, under halogen lights, anaesthetised upon the table.\\nShe was corpse-like in unconsciousness. Her chilled cerise fingernails offered a poignant reminder she is a young girl. Viktoria, who is just 11, has a malignant brain tumour. The day before, in the ICU, she had been weepy, fretful and disoriented with brain sickness. She had come with her mother to this 10- storey late-Soviet paediatric facility for a high-risk, potentially life-saving operation.\\nApproached through the echoing shadows of twilit corridors, the ICU had been virtually empty. With so few patients, the hospital seemed over-staffed. At Viktoria’s bedside was one of the world’s best-known neurosurgeons, Henry Marsh, the author of Do No Harm, and a celebrity in Ukraine. Here, as much as in Britain, Marsh commands attention for his instinctive candour, a lifetime of experience and his bracing clarity. The author Karl Ove Knausgaard once wrote of Marsh: “His job is to slice into the brain, the most complex structure we know of in the universe, where everything that makes us human is contained.”\\nViktoria’s mother was frightened at the prospect of her daughter’s surgery, but “Professor Marsh” presented a cool and impressively frank assessment of the risks and likely outcomes. Although Marsh operates around the world, Lviv is an apt destination for a surgeon who is a junkie for jeopardy. This former Austro-Hungarian provincial capital, once called Lemberg, has been described as the “soul city” of Ukraine. Blink, and you could be in pre-Anschluss Vienna. Barely 50 miles from the Polish border, Lemberg’s cobblestones have the melancholy of streets steeped in atrocities. Long before the current civil war, fought out at the eastern, pro-Russian end of the country, European Ukraine saw Nazi war crimes, and murderous Polish blood feuds, mixed with the horrors of endemic antisemitism.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Moments of truth: Henry Marsh examines a brain scan with fellow doctors. Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer\\n\\n\\nMarsh, who has been coming here since 1992, just after the collapse of the USSR, admits to “a slight obsession” with the transgressive, marginal side of Ukraine, a country that appeals to his maverick instincts.\\nIn the nationalist half of Ukraine, visiting Europeans such as Marsh – an English surgeon of half-German descent conducting a neurosurgical consultancy – offer a parable of an evolving Europe, in which a society at war with Russia struggles to find a place in the new European order through the assistance of philanthropic outsiders.\\nToday’s operation says a lot about post-Soviet Ukraine, and possibly even more about Marsh. Ask him about his German mother, her guilt about fleeing the Nazis and his own need to atone for the past; at once you are plunged into the abyss of mitteleuropean history.\\nMarsh has watched the country torn apart by the Euromaidan conflict of 2013, seen pitched battles between demonstrators and the Berkut riot police, and devoted a lot of time to help improve an antiquated medical system. He identifies strongly with Ukraine’s drive for independence. “My work,” he says, “was part of the same struggle against corrupt autocracy as the Euromaidan protests.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Cutting edge: Marsh and Taras Mykytyn, operating on Viktoria’s brain. Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer\\n\\n\\nIn those days, when local medicine was decades behind the west, Marsh worked pro bono, to share a lifetime of experience. He still donates his time and remembers how, on his first visit to Kiev, one of two centres for neurosurgery in the USSR, operating theatres contained buckets with the brains of patients who had died after treatment for acoustic tumours.\\nMarsh, who made two films (Your Life in Their Hands and The English Surgeon) about his experiences, became something of a local hero, and then published Do No Harm, the surprise hit of 2014, adding to his celebrity status. Today, he can’t walk down the street in Lviv without getting stopped for selfies or autographs.\\nOn this visit, literature and medicine have intersected. He’s here to launch his new book, Admissions, and to operate in the Orlika Street hospital, having moved from his former base in Kiev to help his friend, the neurosurgeon Andriy Myzak, and colleague Taras Mykytyn establish good surgical routines.\\nThe hospital is a microcosm of a society in painful transition, fully equipped with up-to-date technology but lacking both the staff and the management disciplines appropriate to 21st century medicine. Marsh’s philanthropic endeavours will soon run into the same problems. Nevertheless, in anticipation of a long day’s work, Marsh remains optimistic. He prefers Ukraine’s operating theatres: “They have windows,” he said. Such attractions are a rare bonus. At 67, he’s reaching most surgeons’ sell-by date. In his new book, indeed, he confesses to moments of deep anxiety before embarking on another investigation of the cortex. In the theatre, he betrays none of these qualms, projecting bonhomie and confidence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  In recovery: 11-year-old Viktoria and her mother in intensive care after her surgery. Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer\\n\\n\\nWhen I joined Marsh and his team of 12 (three surgeons and nine nursing assistants), the world of wellness remained tantalisingly close; beyond the Winnie-the-Pooh stencils on the windows it’s a lovely late-autumn day with sunshine gilding the birch trees.\\nMarsh chatted to the anaesthetist while the team prepared.\\nThe tumour was on Viktoria’s brainstem. It was going to be a tricky operation, but unavoidable. “Without treatment,” said Marsh, “she would be dead in a few weeks.”\\nFirst, they positioned the patient’s head for surgery, a delicate manoeuvre. Once the incision had been made, and the skull opened, Marsh and his surgeons navigated their way to the tumour with a microscope.\\nThanks to a Canadian-Ukrainian benefactor, this rundown former Soviet hospital boasts state-of-the-art surgical equipment. The problem, said Marsh, is the lack of training. “My analogy for Ukraine is that it’s a like a Trabant wanting to become a Ferrari.”\\nMarsh’s role that morning was to supervise. “I’m keen not to do too much,” he said. “My job is to teach. The point is to help the next generation.” We looked across the theatre to Mykytyn, who was preparing to open the patient’s skull. “I don’t want to be a white wizard, flying in as a kind of hit-and-run consultant,” confided Marsh. He broke off to ask about the Ukrainian word for “happy”. It’s important to conduct dangerous brain surgery in a stress-free atmosphere, he instructed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Quite reflection: prayers for healing, as a society at war with Russia struggles to find its place in the new European order. Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer\\n\\n\\nThe Orlika team, fully scrubbed up, moved round the operating table like actors in costume. Marsh stood apart: watchful, focused and poised for action. At about 10am, the gruesome “bone-work” began – the application of drills and retractors to expose the patient’s brain. It’s a slow and delicate operation. The smell of burned flesh mingled with the faint chemical tang of ketamine. The only sign of life on the operating table was the barely perceptible rise and fall of Viktoria’s chest.\\nBy 11.10, most of the bone-work was completed. At 12.15pm, the microscope was wheeled into position and Marsh began to extract the tumour. “Lovely,” he said, as the procedure proceeded. His biggest worry (has the tumour attached itself to the brain-stem?) seemed to have been resolved. At 1.10pm, Marsh looked up from the microscope: “It’s not bleeding heavily, which is nice.”\\nSurgeons hate bleeding. He instructed Mykytyn about what they could see on the monitor: “That’s not tumour, that’s brain-stem.” It was an awesome moment: in this procedure, Marsh was operating at the crossroads of Viktoria’s consciousness.\\nFinally, at 1.35pm, with a tricky manoeuvre complete, everyone could relax. Marsh was cock-a-hoop. He advised Mykytyn to have “a 10-minute wait” before closing the wound, to ensure no further bleeding: “Let’s have an English cup of tea.” He was plainly relieved at the immediate outcome of a hard morning’s work.\\nBut there was no let-up for the celebrity visitor. While Mykytyn and the team wheeled Viktoria back to the ICU, Marsh took the creaky lift downstairs to conduct an out-patients’ clinic, surrounded by more trainees.\\nA mother and her teenage son came in, nervous in the presence of the famous English surgeon, clutching an MRI scan. Marsh affected no interest in the scan. Through an interpreter, he questioned mother and son.\\n“How dizzy? Since when? Where?” When, finally, he looked at the negative, it was as a veteran of neurosurgery who had spent a lifetime studying more than 50,000 brain scans.\\n“I’m not sure what this is,” he said, frankly. “It could be cortical dysplasia. I’d do another scan in a year’s time. The advantage is that it’s completely safe. The disadvantage of waiting is the anxiety. But, if it’s cortical dysplasia, there’ll be no need to operate.” He smiled encouragement at the boy. “You’ll just have to think about something else. Have a busy life. Get on with things. We call it ‘distraction.’” At home in England, Marsh fills his spare time with bee-keeping, DIY and woodworking.\\nAndriy Myzak hurried in, looking worried. There were post-operative complications with Viktoria. The outpatients’ session went into temporary recess while Marsh consulted. “Let’s wake her up and see,” he concluded.\\nThe afternoon wore on, Marsh handing out verdicts. To reassure one patient, he introduced himself as “the strange Englishman”; to another he complimented their “nice brain”. Despite the off-stage drama of Viktoria’s fate, his mood was decisive and upbeat. Eventually, he rose from his chair, stretching: “Welcome to the terrible world of brain surgery.”\\nThe next day there was an air of despondency; the day’s schedule was cancelled. Viktoria had suffered overnight bleeding, and needed urgent treatment. While Marsh waited to go back into theatre, he conducted further outpatient consultations. A local TV crew turned up to capture “Professor Marsh” in action. Had he achieved his goals here? “Not yet,” he replied. He insisted there was still “a way to go”, that neurosurgery is “dangerous”, and that “we should learn from our mistakes.”\\nIt was very late before Marsh reappeared, visibly exhausted. Viktoria was back in the ICU, in a coma. He spoke, with dismay, about his experience of Ukraine medicine, and the crippling shortage of trained staff. Does he ever get frustrated ? “Oh yes, but I am resigned to achieving very little. We’re talking about ripples in a pond. Lecturing to medical students is probably more important than operating.” He reflected on the long arc of history. “Maybe in future they will try to change things. The Ukrainians must sort out their problems for themselves; the poverty and corruption of the country will not be solved quickly.”\\nTwo days later, we got the news we had all feared. Viktoria was dead.\\nMarsh seemed resigned. In Do No Harm, he quoted the French physician René Leriche, saying: “Every surgeon carries within himself a small cemetery.” Marsh had been here before, a successful procedure followed by post-operative complications. He blamed himself for not properly checking out the post-op care, but added that this is part of the systemic failure of Ukraine medicine.\\n“She almost certainly died from hopeless post-op care on the ICU,” he said. “The chances of her recovering from the bleed were pretty slim. The tumour was malignant; it may well have killed her eventually despite radiotherapy. So perhaps it’s better she died quickly, but who’s to know?”\\nHow were his spirits, I asked. “It is obviously horrible (he later confessed to being “utterly depressed for several days”), but I have been through worse over the years. Poor Taras [Mykytyn] is devastated.”\\nThe pioneering medical reformer in Marsh quickly reasserted itself: “The important thing now is trying to improve post-op care. I have come to understand better the feeling of hopelessness that affects many Ukrainians. How can one change anything when the whole system is corrupt and broken?”\\nLater, back in Britain, he reflected on his recent experience: “I go up and down like a yo-yo when I am in Ukraine, and return home exhausted. What keeps me going is the fact that my colleagues want me to continue to visit and work with them. I cannot really stop.”\\n Admissions by Henry Marsh is published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson at £16.99. To order a copy for £12.99, go to guardianbookshop.com',\n",
       " 'In fields across Switzerland the harvest time for cannabis is coming to an end, and workers are distributing the crop to shops in France and Switzerland. Soon, the plants could be available across much of Europe.\\nThe man behind the operation is 31-year-old Jonas Duclos, a former banker, and what he is doing is legal. His business, CBD420, sells BlueDream, a strain of hemp cultivated to ensure the level of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, is low enough (0.2%) to be lawful in most European countries. The UK is one of the exceptions: any trace of THC is outlawed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are the true risks of taking cannabis?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile low in THC, BlueDream is high in cannabidiol (CBD), another compound found in cannabis, which is non-psychoactive and has been shown to have medicinal qualities, for example, acting as a powerful anti-inflammatory. CBD is not a controlled substance in Europe, and in Britain does not require a licence from the Home Office to be sold if it can be extracted from cannabis.\\nDuclos’s “legal weed” is on sale in more than 1,000 tobacco shops in Switzerland, where THC is allowed up to 1% concentration, and in 15 to 20 shops in France, where the limit is 0.2%. \\n“There is a loophole that lets us bring it on the market,” Duclos explains. The plan is now to take the product elsewhere in Europe, with Italy among his next targets. While the company’s low-THC hemp is illegal in the UK, its CBD oils and balms will be available in some British shops from mid-December.\\nTo comply with European law, Duclos has to make sure his CBD products are not marketed as medicines. Last year, the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) ruled that any product containing CBD marketed as a medicine must have a licence before it can be sold.\\nIan Hamilton, a lecturer in mental health at York University, explains: “There is considerable confusion about the legal status of products which contain cannabis extracts such as cannabidiol. Suppliers of these products were instructed by the MHRA to remove any products they were selling until the appropriate licence was obtained. But this will leave many people who use these products unsure if they are breaking the law or not.”\\nHe adds: “Some CBD products are already marketed as nutritional supplements. But irrespective of how it is marketed, the main risk to the individual is probably not that of being arrested … if they try a do-it-yourself treatment they may be putting their health at risk, and even if they do consult their GP it is unlikely they will have sufficient evidence or knowledge to advise the individual.”\\nDuclos says the slow expansion of BlueDream in France is because of uncertainty as to how the government will respond, Duclos says. “Every shop gets an order of 100 jars to prevent any reaction from the authorities … But the demand is huge.”\\nHe adds: “If the French government goes against it, then that is its choice, but the population there are now very pro-cannabis. We shall see; it is obviously not our decision and we will comply and stop any distribution in France if required. For now, all we can do is make sure our products respect the THC level under 0.2% and just like in Switzerland, we are not allowed to market hemp as a medicine. We don’t recommend people smoke it. Even if someone can experience potential benefits, smoking is never healthy.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSay Why To Drugs – the highs and lows of cannabis\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrowing interest in products containing cannabis extract comes at a time of changing laws around marijuana use. Several European countries have relaxed their laws, including the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal, and in the US eight states have formally legalised recreational use of the drug. Many other countries, including Germany, now allow the drug to be used for medicinal reasons.\\nSuch changes in legislation have also prompted scientists to call for a safer way to produce cannabis. One suggestion is to boost levels of CBD so users can get their hit while lessening the potential risks from THC.\\nAmir Englund and other researchers at King’s College London have begun an experimental study to find the optimal ratio between THC and CBD. Volunteers are given THC to CBD ratios of 1:0, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3, and the study will look at which combination is associated with fewest negative effects on memory and paranoia.\\nEnglund says: “Most of the cannabis sold on the UK black market [has] high THC and low or absent CBD levels. Several lines of research have pointed towards this type of cannabis being riskier.\\n“Recent UK figures have found that overall cannabis use has been declining while number of people seeking treatment for cannabis use problems or psychiatric admission have been rising. One of the main candidate explanations has been the growing dominance of this high THC-potency cannabis. Some studies have found that CBD on its own can be antipsychotic.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCannabis: scientists call for action amid mental health concerns\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDuclos says: “All we need now is a real law and regulation around the use of these substances for everyone, and for authorities to apply the law and for all products to be fully controlled. A law covering every aspect so people get the cleanest product possible and can choose which THC and CBD level they want, depending on their needs. Under a controlled regulation, we can even expect a better education for everyone, the black market to decrease and tax revenues for the state to increase as it has in the US.”But whatever the future holds, Duclos says this is an issue that will not go away. He adds that he does not mind being the one to push the government for a response. “At any moment, the French authorities could say, ‘Oh let’s say CBD is now the same as THC and should be illegal. Then it is over in France … honestly, it is fun – we are poking the government and saying ‘What you think about that?’”',\n",

For the next 21 years the summit observatory was manned continuously by three meteorologists, with detailed measurements taken every hour, day and night, throughout the year.

       " 'The geneticist Alan Dickinson, who has died aged 87, was aware even as a young man that he might not live to answer the question that dominated his career: what causes mind-rotting diseases such as scrapie in sheep and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in people? Such was the risk faced by a scientist who in the 1950s chose to specialise in a field then known as “slow viruses”.\\nAs these disorders, joined in the 1980s by mad cow disease, were reclassified over the years as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and, latterly, “prion” diseases, the research group that Dickinson founded in Edinburgh trod a unique path. Whereas rival labs elsewhere in the UK and abroad attempted to reduce diseased brains until all that was left was the pathogen, and then routinely failed, Dickinson preferred to study clinical symptoms and patterns of brain damage caused by scrapie in generations of specially inbred mice, then gradually deduce what kind of infectious agent might be causing it.\\nSupported by the Moredun Research Institute, the Animal Breeding Research Organisation, the Agricultural Research Council, the Medical Research Council and the American National Institutes of Health, in the late 1960s and throughout the 70s Dickinson, with his early collaborators George Outram and Hugh Fraser, began to publish a series of groundbreaking reports, many in the journal Nature. Among their findings: that a host gene affected susceptibility to disease and that scrapie came in distinct strains with clearly differentiated incubation times, clinical symptoms and patterns of brain damage.\\nPerhaps the most important and least appreciated of their discoveries was something called “blocking”. If introduced first into a test mouse, a slow-acting strain of scrapie could beat a fast one. This told Dickinson that a host offered only so many sites for the scrapie agent to perch on before it began blocking access to other strains.\\nThe work was regarded as seminal by Dickinson’s peers, but greater glory proved elusive. In 1976 the US physician Daniel Gajdusek was awarded the Nobel prize for showing that a South Pacific variant of CJD could be transmitted by exposure to infected brain. Yet it was not Gajdusek who that year warned about the CJD danger posed by treating dwarfism in thousands of children in the US, Europe and Australia with human growth hormone rendered from cadaver brains. That was Dickinson, who later confirmed a safe purification protocol.\\nThe compensation still going to families of more than 70 British hormone recipients who died from the treatments with inadequately purified hormone were backdated to the first clearly stated circulation of Dickinson’s warning.\\nTwo decades later, in the heat of the mad cow crisis of the 1990s, a second Nobel in the field went to another American rival, the neurologist Stanley Prusiner of the University of California, San Francisco, who speculated that the scrapie agent was a novel infectious protein, which he named a “prion”. Prions, he suggested, were misfolded proteins that triggered cascading neurodegeneration without the help of a conventional pathogen, the “slow virus” of yore, which would require genetic programming in the form of a nucleic acid. The assertion flew headlong at the strain-typing work done by Dickinson’s group, and has yet to be conclusively validated.\\nBy the time Prusiner’s Nobel was announced, Dickinson was gone from the lab that he had founded at Edinburgh University, a victim less of an ambitious American rival than of his own deeply ingrained traits.\\nBorn to Isabella (nee Loynd) and Golborne Dickinson, mill owners, in Blackburn, Lancashire, just as India’s boycott and the Great Depression devastated the cotton industry, Dickinson grew up during an era of second world war austerity, and was given to taking resourcefulness to occasional extremes. Not long after completing an undergraduate degree at Liverpool University and a doctorate in genetics at Birmingham, he moved with his parents, his wife, Helen (nee Morris), whom he had married in 1953, and their children to Scotland, where farmers were funding scrapie work.\\nBy way of lodgings, he found a rambling old house where, his daughter Jane recalled, “not all rooms had floorboards”. When the floor gave way in the family’s old Triumph Herald, Dickinson fixed it using a bucket. Family holidays were taken in a Bedford camper van.\\nStaff meetings at the lab, remembered Outram, were such egalitarian affairs that everyone from animal house workers to secretaries to scientists attended. “All had to hear what was going on,” he said. “Scientists every week had to spend some time cleaning animal cages so we appreciated what that was about.”\\nRunning a lab like a Quaker meeting was only possible in the rank-conscious world of government science because Dickinson had scrambled for funds from steadily evolving research councils in ways that left his lab, the Neuropathogenesis Unit (NPU) at Edinburgh, more or less autonomous. However, when in 1987 the NPU was made an administrative satellite of the Institute for Animal Health at Compton, Berkshire, Dickinson quit. He was, at the end of his career, inherently allergic to being managed.\\nThe departure left Fraser and a young pathologist, Moira Bruce, to strain-type a newly emerging cattle disease that would within a decade explode into an epidemic so catastrophic that it contributed to the downfall of the Tory government. Only Dickinson’s strain-typing method enabled researchers in the UK to track the progress of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) – also known as mad cow disease – from cattle to exotic zoo antelopes to a cat and, ultimately, to humans. Dickinson’s final public stand was a tireless barrage of pestering to force the young Labour government in 1997 to set up a public inquiry into the origins of mad cow disease. In this he was successful.\\nBy 1999, concerned by his wife’s double diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease, Dickinson moved from the house where he had filled in the missing flooring, painted the bathroom purple and lime green, and built a garden so beautiful that the horticulturist Christopher Lloyd came to call. The devout Congregationalist couple who had courted in morning prayers as undergraduates at Liverpool before joining Quaker meetings in Edinburgh captured another 13 years together before Helen died in 2012.\\nDickinson is survived by their five children, Ruth, Karen, Jane, Stephen and John, and four grandchildren, Margaret, Lisa, Sam and Ross.\\n• Alan Dickinson, geneticist, born 30 March 1930; died 27 September 2017',\n",
       " 'Why do good people suffer? Five words to take you into a dense maze of ideas philosophical, psychological and theological. Where to start? What suffering looks or feels like is probably one of the most subjective notions we can ponder. Even the way we usually categorise suffering – “physical” or “mental” – is blurry, because rarely does one come without the other. Our minds hurt when our bodies hurt, and vice versa.\\nIf we put aside the “good” or “bad” ranking – for now – and ask why any person suffers, we can start at the beginning: when our body, pulled apart from the one we grew inside, is suspended in the world on its own for the first time. Birth.\\nIn the book The Trauma of Birth (1924), the psychoanalyst Otto Rank – one of Freud’s closest colleagues – wrote that all human beings suffer trauma by virtue of being born. Expanding on Freud’s theories from the beginning of the 1900s, when he famously called birth “the first experience of anxiety, and thus the source and prototype of the affect of anxiety”, Rank believed the physical event of being born to be not only the first anxiety a person knows, but also the blueprint of all anxiety experienced over the arc of their life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHave I got depression? You asked Google – here’s the answer | Jay Watts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeing thrust from a state of perfect, warm union with our mother into a cold, distressing state of separation does seem like a rough start to this living business. Psychoanalysts are fascinated with birth trauma and what psychological imprinting occurs when there are complications. I was born with my umbilical cord constricting my neck, boa-like (according to my mum, my face was “the colour of Ribena”), and have a decidedly anxious constitution. A psychoanalytic therapist I saw for a while seemed fixated on the synonymity of these two facts.\\nIt is as easy to have a knee-jerk aversion to determinist ideas (“I am not born to suffer! I have control over my destiny!”) as it is to get stuck in them (“My parents screwed me up for ever!”), because that’s less frightening than really examining ourselves. But if trauma is an inescapable fact of our early lives, then research has shown that many variables can influence our individual levels of suffering later on.\\nThe British psychoanalyst Wilfred Bion believed that the birth experience either remains distressing or becomes psychologically manageable, depending on the level of attachment to our mother. We don’t just need physical protection, he said, we need our mothers to “contain” our earliest emotional states – the wild sensory impressions given to the mind before actual thinking and context-giving can happen. We need to feel our trauma is survivable. Bion believed this happens when our early feelings are taken in and “named” by the mother and, therefore, can then be limited or solved. With secure attachment, we can know what distress feels like – even if that distress is coming from something as innocuous as trapped wind – but also that love and support can help us feel better. We learn what it means to manage our suffering.\\nAs adults, some of us seem to cope and co-exist with suffering. Some of us find it more difficult. The importance of early secure attachment on our emotional resilience later in life is now widely accepted in psychology and, after decades of minimising the effects of negative events in childhood, researchers have established that a broad range of adverse childhood events are significant risk factors for most mental health problems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  ‘Netflix drama Mindhunter provides an entertaining insight into the convergence of behavioural science and criminality.’ Photograph: Patrick Harbron/Netflix\\n\\n\\nThe Adverse Childhood Experiences studies show that childhood trauma and neglect manifest not just in mental distress but as chronic inflammation and compromised immune responses in the body. Our bodies hurt when our minds hurt. If we think about the phenomenological experience of physical pain, it can drill a black hole into our emotional life. People living with chronic pain are suffering not only with the physical aspects of that pain, but also with the loss of identity that comes with being detached from things that brought meaning to their life. In a recent clinical placement within a chronic pain service, I met people who said that the monotony enforced on their lives by pain was the worst aspect of their suffering.\\nAs to the great why of suffering, psychologist Jay Watts wrote in the Guardian earlier this year about how psychological and social factors are, for many of us, the main cause. “Poverty, relative inequality, being subject to racism, sexism, displacement and a competitive culture all increase the likelihood of mental suffering,” she says. The associations are powerful, unlike the current political appetite to listen to mental health professionals’ views on the impact of structural inequalities. “Add into the mix individual experiences such as childhood sexual abuse, early separation, emotional neglect, chronic invalidation and bullying, and we get a clearer picture of why some people suffer more than others.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nAnti-natalist philosopher David Benatar believes that, because life is so painful, no one should ever have kids again\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nIt seems safe to argue that all human beings suffer in their individual way. There are even “anti-natalist” philosophers, such as David Benatar, who believe that, because life is so bloody painful, no one should ever have kids again. We don’t make things any easier for ourselves by sticking “good” or “bad” labels on to people, either. What makes a person good or bad? If we branch from this fundamental question, we must then ask: do “bad” people not suffer? Do they deserve to? Do good people, by virtue of the good things they do, not deserve to? If there is a moral hierarchy of suffering, who decides its levels?\\nTo an extent, criminal law provides such a hierarchy. When analysing “bad” human behaviour – for the sake of argument let’s say that which causes gratuitous suffering to another person – the “mad, sad or bad?” question is often posed in the field of criminal psychology. To what end a killer’s pathology – a florid psychotic episode as a result of an untreated mental health issue, say – should affect their punishment (and enforced suffering) is a consideration that runs through justice systems across the word. The Netflix drama Mindhunter, based on the true story of the man who pioneered the profiling of serial killers, provides an entertaining insight into the convergence of behavioural science and criminality. As the series shows, those inflicting grave suffering in their adult lives have often experienced childhood trauma. There is data to support the victim-to-victimiser cycle of sexual abuse. Do the perpetrators of such crimes deserve some kind of rehabilitation, then, or do they deserve to suffer? Do they, as human beings, deserve a decent existence as their days play out?\\nDeath penalty states say no: “eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot” (Exodus 21:24). Countries such as Norway, with its prisons focusing on humanity, say yes (and also happen to have some of the lowest re-offending rates in Europe). Whether we can change people – and therefore limit further unnecessary human suffering in society – by power is an ongoing debate. There is no greater act of power than one human being ending another’s life. For some victims of crime, their suffering may be lessened by a perpetrator’s death. For others, a sense of justice – and therefore a reduction in suffering – comes from an offender being in prison and losing their freedom. In modern neuroscience, the concept of “evil” is a bit old-hat. Within the brain’s limbic system is an almond-shaped cluster of nuclei involved in processing our fears and pleasures. In fMRI scans (measuring brain activity by changes associated with blood flow), murderers and other violent criminals have been shown to have amygdalae that aren’t functioning properly. A recent study found that those with markers of “limbic neural maldevelopment” have “significantly higher levels of antisocial personality, psychopathy, arrests and convictions compared with controls”.\\nIn removing free will or conscious choice, can we really say that those who commit such grave acts of cruelty are victims of their own faulty wiring? Such brain-based roots of “evil” could lead to testing for predispositions to certain behaviours. A 2010 study suggested that amygdala dysfunction in children as young as three could cause impaired responses to fear that precede criminality in adulthood. However, implementing such testing in any kind of widespread way would be an ethical minefield.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs mental illness real? You asked Google – here’s the answer | Jay Watts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf we are asking why “good” people suffer, the implication, really, is that suffering should be reserved for the “bad”. When we talk about “good” people, we tend to lean towards a person’s level of empathy – how they understand and act on the welfare of others. The ability to put ourselves in someone else’s shoes is a crucial part of our social development. Lack of empathy was long thought to be a primary trait of psychopathy, but research in the last few years has pointed towards the idea of an empathy “switch” – the ability to turn it on and off. Put a psychopath under a scanner and they may be able to summon an empathetic response to order. In the real world, just because they can doesn’t mean they will.\\nWhen we feel pain we want to make sense of it. We hunt for a cause. The brain wants to find reasons because cognitive dissonance is so uncomfortable. But really, there is no such thing as a “good” person who is always rewarded and a “bad” person who is always punished. There is no such thing as a human being who has never suffered. The rupturing of these illusions is, perhaps, what we find so unsettling.\\n• Eleanor Morgan is the author of Anxiety for Beginners: A Personal Investigation and is training to be a psychologist',\n",
       " 'The news that left-handers excel at some sports but not others confirmed my thoughts that the 10% of people that make up us southpaws are used to punching above our weight. A study published in the journal Biology Letters concludes that being left-handed is an advantage in sports where time pressures are particularly severe – such as table tennis, or cricket, or squash.\\nI am the exception to the rule – I manage to be equally rubbish at any sport regardless of whether it be fast or slow. My PE teacher told me at least I had one good tennis shot in me, but I felt that was a backhanded compliment. But if we left-handers lead at sports such as cricket or tennis, it is yet to make up for the inequality we face in everyday life.\\nI always held dear the fact I was born a left-hander. It felt like a little badge of honour, like having a little superpower. To this day, I find myself scanning the room to seek out kindred spirits and upon discovering a fellow left-hander, giving them a knowing wink and a smile.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSociety’s inability to cater for left-handers is an issue that needs tackling\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nConversely, I find I am unfairly judged by right-handed folk. “Oh, you’re a lefty,” they say in a tone that would normally be reserved for someone with a terminal illness. In fact, many right-handers still mistakenly believe that left-handed people die younger, a theory long since debunked, thankfully.\\nMeeting people for the first time is difficult, especially those who offer a handshake at the earliest opportunity from their right side. You either have to accept it and lead with your weaker right hand and face being judged poorly for dispatching such a weedy handshake, or persist with offering the left hand which then forces your new acquaintance with having to put down whatever they are holding in their left hand in order to fulfil a frankly quirky social custom. Why can’t we bump chests and be done with it?\\nWhile I have never been forced to favour my right hand by teachers or anyone else in positions of authority, I have still been treated unfairly. Keen to learn the guitar at the age of 11 with a new indie revolution whirring in our social consciousness, I signed up for a lunchtime music club in which we’d be taught the basics. I was met with a sigh, a grunt and a grumpy teacher mumbling something about “having to restring the thing” and: “Can you not use your right hand like everyone else?”\\nI later self-taught right-handed five years later – turned out it would have been a massive pain to restring the thing after all – but by then I’d missed Britpop so it was all pointless anyway.\\nAlong with using a PC mouse, it’s the only time I have betrayed my left-handedness in favour of convenience. The rest of the time, it’s one big struggle.\\nMealtimes at the family table were fraught with problems when my right-handed brother and I would sit together. We’d end up elbowing each other furiously. Mind you that had nothing to do with being left-handed, I just hated him.\\nSociety’s inability to cater for left-handers is an issue that needs tackling. Writing with anything other than a pencil is a chore. Once, when I was provided with a fountain pen to practise neat handwriting at school, there was more ink on my hand than there was on the paper, creating the impression that I had wrestled with a squid.\\nNovelty coffee cups are a waste of time – the funny messages are always written on the wrong side. The cups that have a tray beneath the drinking reservoir in order to conceal biscuits favours the right-hander, meaning you cover yourself in Hobnobs whenever taking a drink of your brew. Personalised pens almost always see the bearer’s name written from the nib outwards, meaning that left-handers have to get used to seeing their names upside down.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy do left-handers excel at certain elite sports but not others?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKettles are often ergonomically designed to benefit right-handers.

The list goes on and on.\\nYes, there are items specifically designed for left-handers. But these need to be on the high street shelves, not hidden away in some shop resembling Ned Flanders’ Leftorium from The Simpsons.\\nIt’s great that we’re better than you at some sports, and that we’re generally better people – Barack Obama is one of us – but the playing field that is life needs to be levelled up.

       " 'They were Child A and Child B. The public weren’t told the names of\\xa0the boys, Robert Thompson and Jon\\xa0Venables, until they had been found guilty of the murder of two-year-old James Bulger in 1993. The decision by the judge to reveal the identities of the pair was controversial, causing complications and difficulties that were outlined by Sir David Omand in his 2010 review of the probation service’s handling of the case.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJames Bulger killer back in jail after being caught with abuse images again\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNevertheless, despite the logistical and moral difficulties the judge’s decision unleashed, we are where we are. The bare bones of the progress the two men have made since their release seven years ago is common knowledge. Thompson is reported as living a stable life in a stable community with a partner\\xa0who knows of his past. Venables has just returned to custody for a second\\xa0time, for offences involving child\\xa0pornography.\\nAt the time of the trial it was Child A, Thompson, who was characterised as the moving force behind the long, slow, dawdling, merciless crime. Venables’ defence lawyer described Thompson as a “pied piper”. A detective on the case, Phil Roberts, forcefully informed the media that this was his impression too. Others said that Thompson showed no remorse, while Venables did. As the extreme delinquency of Venables continues into his mid-30s, it’s tempting to conclude that they got it wrong. Very tempting.\\nExcept that the obvious conclusion isn’t always the right one. Perhaps the situation is counterintuitive. Maybe Venables is less able to close the door on his past precisely because his guilt and shame are greater. Is it likely? Is it possible? Does it even matter? The most obvious fact of all remains. Those boys did something profoundly and outlandishly cruel and wrong. One of them still hangs around the periphery of that dark place, even though he should have the intelligence and maturity to understand the consequences, for himself and for the children in the images he seeks.\\nIs it even right to speculate?\\nOne difficulty is that releasing personal information in the public interest tends to feed a desire for further information. In a case as horrific as this one – the two remain the youngest convicted murderers in modern English history – a desire for more information would always have persisted. People are drawn to the bleakest corners of human capability, confronted by the choice, as framed by former prime minister John Major, as to whether the thrust of their response should be to “understand” or\\xa0“condemn”.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nLiberals like to believe in the perfection of the newborn human as much as Christians do\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nFor a lot of people, the trajectory of Venables since his term in rehabilitative custody would confirm condemnation to be the correct response. But even that isn’t a straightforward judgment to make. For our understanding of human malfunction has markedly increased since 1993. Neuroscience has advanced, in part due to the development of diffusion tensor MRI technology. A study conducted at King’s College London in 2009 that considered nine diagnosed psychopaths found that their brain images showed significant deficit in the uncinate fasciculus. This connects the amygdala, which controls major emotional responses including fear and aggression, to the orbitofrontal cortex, which controls important decision-making. It’s a physical tract, an infrastructure for the neural pathways that can be strengthened or weakened by environment. A defective tract, possibly congenital, means defective thinking, possibly congenital. Which is not to say that either Thompson or Venables themselves are psychopaths. I know no more than anyone else with access to the internet, and probably a lot less than many. But experts who have had access to the two men resist such a diagnosis. My wider point is more about the condemning and the understanding.\\nOne of the fascinating things about this case is that, despite public revulsion at the idea the boys could be helped to live useful lives, those in favour of understanding have been vindicated, thus far, in the case of Thompson. Yet even this is a moral hall of mirrors. If Thompson is the one more capable of control, then why didn’t he exercise it? The positive aspect of this is that one possible conclusion is that therapeutic help enabled him to develop and grow more typical neurological regulation. Environmental intervention can cause people to change, especially children and young people.\\nBut what of the people who can’t change, or can’t change enough? The King’s College research suggests environment is not everything. Why should it be? Congenital physical abnormalities in the brain, by far our most complex organ, are surely far more likely than congenital heart defects.\\nThere are both condemners and understanders who are too keen on this logical\\xa0assumption. Liberals like to believe in the perfection of the newborn human as much as Christians do. It’s one of the irritations of humanism. For them, environment is all. Condemners, however, tend to be big on moral responsibility. This guy had a much worse childhood than that guy, they’ll say, and he did OK. They’re Old Testament. They love the idea of evil and wickedness, of full human choice and the full human choice of darkness. Even the word dyslexia, for them, is like a red rag to a bull.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNeuroscientists create ‘atlas’ showing how words are organised in the brain\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe condemners have some grounds for scepticism, by their own lights anyway. In the US, brain scans are being used more often in criminal trials, largely for technical reasons, to argue that a convict’s sentence should be reduced because his original defence didn’t present evidence of brain abnormalities, or that his sentence should be lighter because brain deficiencies reduce culpability.\\nAgain, though, all of these people, the lawyers and those who dislike the science they are using, miss the point. Understanding is not a synonym for forgiveness. No matter how capable or incapable people are of controlling their actions, they are sometimes a danger to others. It’s for those others, not just for moral satisfaction, that freedom sometimes needs to be restricted or curtailed. Jon Venables, right now, is exactly where Jon Venables needs to be.\\n• Deborah Orr is a Guardian columnist',\n",
       " \"To say that somebody is a “product of their environment” is to suggest that their actions or behaviour can be explained by where they’ve grown up, where they’ve worked and, in particular, who they’ve had around them.\\nFor example, a child isn’t born with a certain view on race, gender or a favourite football team. I have a school friend who earned a work placement at a bank in the City and he wasn’t even a little bit of a tosser when he merrily travelled off to Liverpool Street in 2002. However, I’m almost certain that the 15 years he’s spent within that environment has possibly helped chisel out the man who stood before me at a recent reunion said he was “more than happy to spunk his latest bonus up the wall”.\\nI believe a similar fate has befallen our old friend Twitter. For the purposes of this piece I’m going to make Twitter a 36-year-old female – a Virgo who loves tennis and spaghetti hoops. But how you choose to manifest your own “human Twitter” is entirely up to you.\\nMy good friend Twitter used to be such a fun person, always making me laugh, and able to do so within 140 characters or less, which only added to her charm. But lately when I see Twitter, she’s sad and angry – and I can understand why, as all of her stories seem to focus on world leaders being dangerously inept, sexual assault charges and body-shaming.\\nThen the other day, Twitter told me of a pub in Wimbledon, which on Christmas Day will open its doors to anybody who’s alone or feeling lonely. They will be welcomed with open arms, “a free Christmas dinner and a drink of their favourite festive poison”. The comments underneath the post were moving and heartwarming, and at last Twitter gave a rare smile.\\nI find myself reflecting more and more on this kind-hearted offer. It was a chink of bright light in the vast black hole of Twitter, and raised questions about loneliness that I haven’t pondered before. Of course I was aware of how this time of year affects the lonely, and yes, the idea of it makes me sad; but who aside from a publican in south-west London is doing anything about it? And what can I do to help?\\nI contacted my local Age UK in Camden, a charity that understands only too well the effects of loneliness on older people. I started by asking if they’d seen the tweet from the pub, and they had. The person I was speaking to brought up the comments underneath and says she was moved by them too. I went on to ask about working for a charity such as theirs at this time of year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLoneliness as bad for health as long-term illness, says GPs' chief\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“We try to give all our older community members Christmas gifts in early December and the majority of them will remain unopened in their homes until Christmas Day, so that they have something to open. For many of them it’s the only present they will receive and the only interaction they’ll have with anyone on Christmas Day. And it’s not just Christmas Day; it’s all year round. Our befriending scheme is just so important, plus a lot of our befrienders get so much out of it too.”\\nI’m also told of one lady who came over to the UK from Spain in the 1960s to work for a family as a nanny. She dedicated herself entirely to the family, but of course as the years whizzed by and the kids grew up and moved away, the family sold the house the nanny had called her home for all those years. She is in her 80s now and has lived alone in Kilburn for the past 17 years. She has no family. Nobody to speak of.\\n“A member of our befriending team takes her for tea every Monday afternoon and has apparently been privy to some extraordinary tales from her youth which she loves to share. Just last week we called her as always to make the arrangements for Monday afternoon tea; we shed a little tear in the office when she told us she couldn’t make it to tea that day because one of the children she cared for all those years ago had tracked her down and was coming to visit her from their home in America – she sounded very excited.”\\nYou need only look at the most basic of statistics to see that people are living longer. One day, before we know it, organisations such as Age UK may be very important to us too. Perhaps a little less time on Twitter, and a little more spent out in our communities could help end the loneliness epidemic before it engulfs us all.\\nIn the meantime, I’m taking Twitter for an early eggnog. Her stories have got longer but that’s OK.\\n• You can find out more about befriending in your community on Twitter by following @AgeUK, and the world’s friendliest pub is @TheAlexSW19\\n• Dave Berry is a radio and TV presenter\",\n",
       " 'There are a lot of scientific eyes on west Antarctica right now, for some pretty obvious reasons.\\nThe West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) holds a lot of water – enough to push up sea levels around the world by 3m or so.\\nEven though this sort of melting would play out over century-long time scales, getting a handle on how much melting there would be, and how fast it could happen, are big questions with big consequences. \\nHundreds of millions of people living around coasts and cities around the globe might be interested in the answer, as would cartographers who would need to be redrawing maps of the world. \\nDeep underneath the ice in west Antarctica is a break in the continental landmass – a seaway that links the Weddell Sea to the north with the Amundsen Sea to the south.\\nAbout 120,000 years ago, the Earth was in an interglacial period with temperatures comparable to the 2C of warming that countries who are part of the UN’s Paris agreement (everyone but the US) are all trying to avoid.\\nBut scientists are unsure if enough ice melted during the last interglacial (LIG) to expose that trans-Antarctic seaway. \\nBut, if they could find some clues, then this would give them vital information about the fate of the world’s sea levels.\\nThis is where octopuses come in or, more specifically, what evolutionary biologist Jan Strugnell thinks she could find out using octopus DNA.\\nAssociate Prof Strugnell, of James Cook University in Townsville, Australia, describes an ingenious plan in a scientific paper published in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews, co-written by Joel Pedro of the University of Copenhagen and Nerida Wilson of the Western Australian Museum.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe future of the planet is tied up in that ice.\\n\\nDr Ceridwen Fraser\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nStrugnell writes that by examining the DNA of some bottom-dwelling animals currently living around the entire Antarctic continent, you can work out if the ancestors of those species were able to move through that trans-Antarctic seaway. \\nIt sounds complicated – and it is. \\nBut in the paper Strugnell describes recent advances in genome sequencing that can “provide powerful insight into the demographic history of species including processes such as migration, population divergence and changes in effective population size”.\\nStrugnell tells me if you match the DNA sequencing to powerful modelling, you could work out if that species was able to move across the seaway about 120,000 years ago. If they moved across the seaway, then that would mean enough ice had melted to clear the way. Ingenious!\\nIn the paper, she says the best animals to test would be those that live on the ocean floor and currently exist all around the continent. \\nSpeaking to me, she reveals she already has a possible candidate – the Pareledone turqueti, or Turquet’s octopus. \\nShe says: “The genome of the species contains signatures of what happened to populations in the past and different demographic changes – these are all held within that DNA. \\n“The DNA contains a record of those processes and so we can investigate different hypothesis of what happened in the past – just like your own human DNA contains a record of your ancestors.” \\nStrugnell says a cruder version of these techniques are used in the popular human DNA tests to track a person’s own ancestry.\\nStrugnell has visited Antarctica three times, most recently earlier this year where she was helping gather octopus and other animals that live on the sea floor (scientists get them by either diving or dong small targeted trawling).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Jan Strugnell with an octopus sample in Antarctica. The octpous here is a\\nMegaleledone setebos. Photograph: Peter Enderlein/British Antarctic Survey\\n\\n\\nShe has already used similar DNA techniques to understand the evolution of octopus around Antarctica and now wants to push the technology even further. \\n“The future of the planet is tied up in that ice,” says Dr Ceridwen Fraser, of the Australian National University. Fraser also uses DNA analysis to work out how populations of species have moved around the plant, particularly in Antarctica. \\nShe says the techniques partly use what is known as the “molecular clock” – an understanding of the way genes change, or mutate, in different species. \\nIn recent years, Fraser says there have been giant leaps in the capability of genetic technologies and also in the computer power needed to analyse massive sets of data. \\nShe says Strugnell’s proposal is a “cool idea” and, with recent developments in the technology, was certainly feasible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nI think the timing for this is right. We now have the genetic tools more refined than ever before and we are moving into the era of interdisciplinary scientific research. There’s a lot of eyes on Antarctica right now and a lot of scientists want to know what’s going to happen.\\n\\n\\nProf Richard Alley, of Penn State University, is a glaciologist and expert on ice sheets.\\nHe tells me there were multiple challenges in understanding how the ice sheets had behaved in the past but says Strugnell’s method “looks like a great idea worthy of testing”.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nIt is worth noting that historical science, including paleoclimatic research and other research into Earth’s past and life’s evolution, does indeed generate hypotheses and do new experiments, just as in other branches of science – our ‘historical science’ really is science.\\n\\n\\nHe says the paleoclimate science community (those are researchers studying ancient climates) is constantly coming up with new ways to understand what happened in the past.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nWe are limited to studying the materials left behind from past times but other branches of science do face limitations as well and, like them, we work hard to find the ways to use the possible to answer key questions. We’re not even close to exhausting the possibilities, and may never be, so there is still much to learn. I hope that this new idea is similarly tested.\\n\\n\\nProf John Church, of the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre, is a leading authority on sea level rise.\\nHe ays the WAIS was likely to have made a “significant contribution” to the rising sea levels during the last interglacial “but whether it was a complete collapse is not yet known”.\\n“But the question is an important one,” he says, because high levels of greenhouse emissions would likely cause several metres of sea level rise over the coming centuries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nWe could be committing the world to these higher sea levels this century, depending on our emissions. In addition to what emission and climate trajectories we will choose, the question is how quickly these multimetre sea-level rises could occur. One of the major issues in refining estimates of rates of future sea level rise is the future of the WAIS and other marine ice sheet areas in Antarctica.',\n",
       " 'The news that many water companies use dowsing to locate underground water has prompted outraged demands from scientists that they desist at once from wasting time and money on “medieval witchcraft”. They are right to call this practice deluded. But it reveals how complicated the relationship is between scientific evidence and public belief.\\nWhen the science blogger Sally Le Page highlighted the issue after her parents spotted an engineer dowsing for Severn Trent Water, the company responded to her query by claiming that “we’ve found some of the older methods are just as effective than [sic] the new ones” (such as the use of drones and satellite imaging). The engineer concerned told her parents that dowsing works for him eight times in 10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWater firms backtrack on admissions that they use divining rods\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFurther inquiry elicited the comment from Yorkshire Water that “although few and far between, some of our techs still use them!”, while Anglian Water said: “There have been occasions where we’ve used dowsing rods.” Le Page says that 10 out of 12 British water companies she approached have admitted to the practice. But “admitted” isn’t quite the right word; what is striking is the jaunty tone of these responses, as if to say: “Yes, isn’t it extraordinary that these old methods work?”\\nLet’s be clear: dowsing doesn’t work. Le Page’s blog links to detailed experiments conducted in Germany in the 1980s which showed that the dowsers tested weren’t locating water at levels better than random chance. It’s a good lesson in statistical reasoning: that a few individuals did significantly better than the others, for example, doesn’t attest to a rare talent but to the simple fact that this too is an expectation of random outcomes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe resistance to basic scientific reasoning may seem lamentable, but it shouldn’t surprise us\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nOne of the earliest accounts of dowsing appears in a 16th-century treatise on mining by the German writer Georgius Agricola, where he says it is used to find metal ore deposits, not water. Agricola’s book was noted for its (literally) down-to-earth practicality, although he shares many of the common beliefs of his time – which makes suggestions that dowsing is medieval witchcraft ahistorical. Witchcraft was widely considered to enlist the help of demons, whereas Agricola was the kind of Renaissance humanist who sought to replace such ideas with rational, natural mechanistic explanations for phenomena.\\nDowsers might make the same claim today, but there is no known influence in physics that would account for how buried water would move metal rods. It’s not impossible that an unknown law of physics is being profitably exploited by Severn Trent Water, but hopefully we can agree the likelihood is small.\\nThe resistance to basic scientific reasoning and evidence displayed by large businesses that also deploy cutting-edge space technology may seem lamentable, but it shouldn’t surprise us. It has never been more apparent that an inability to make scientifically informed choices is no obstacle to flourishing in modern society. Besides, regarding superstitions as mere ignorance is itself mistaken; they arise and persist for a reason. When Michael Faraday debunked the table-turning of spiritualist seances in the Times in 1853, saying that (as is probably the case with dowsing) the movements are caused by unconscious small hand movements of the participants, it did nothing to quell the craze. The prospect of communion with the dead was too consoling in that increasingly secular age to relinquish.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDivine intervention: yes, water companies using dowsing really is that bad\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother influence at work in the case of dowsing is the seemingly endless propensity of water to attract pseudoscience. An essential and therefore spiritual substance for all of human existence, water has been so thoroughly imbued with miraculous properties that all kinds of unlikely effects seem to require little leap of imagination. The “memory of water” alleged as an “explanation” of homeopathy was only a pseudoscientific veneer for the longstanding idea of water’s healing powers – which continues to support a quack industry of bizarrely treated bottled waters.\\nGiven that company executives and engineers seem no more immune to pseudoscience than the rest of the population, it’s not obvious that better public education about science is going to dispel the modern-day survival of concepts rooted in Renaissance natural magic. (Whether the public should be expected to bear any costs incurred is quite another matter.) Rather, these beliefs need to be understood – and if necessary confronted – in the way that all magical thinking should be: as an expression of desire and the need for consolation.\\n• Philip Ball is a science writer',\n",
       " \"The healthcare system is facing failure, rooted in an epidemic of misinformed doctors and patients.\\nDuring a recent keynote lecture at the British Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation annual conference, I gave the example of a man who had had a heart attack and been given statins and whose months of disabling muscle pain resolved within a week of stopping taking them. His elation was cut short when his GP told him he must never stop his statin or he could die. When the audience was asked to guess what his risk of death was from stopping the pill for two weeks, the first response was 25%. There were gasps when I revealed it was actually between zero and one in 10,000.\\nSuch statistical and health illiteracy, far from being the exception, is actually the norm.

In his paper How To Survive the Medical Misinformation Mess, Stanford University professor of medicine and statistics John Ioannidis, an authority on scientific integrity, reveals only 7% of more than 60,000 clinical studies analysed passed criteria of being high quality and clinically relevant to patients.\\nWe should also be concerned about the very integrity of medical research on which doctors rely to make clinical decisions. In an international survey of respondents from higher education institutions, 14% admitted to knowing of a colleague who fabricated, falsified or modified data and 34% of scientists report questionable research practices that included selective reporting of clinical outcomes in published research and concealing conflicts of interest.\\nOne prominent Dutch physician, whose work is alleged to have influenced European of Society of Cardiology guidelines on the use of beta blocker drugs in non-cardiac surgery, was dismissed from Erasmus University for “violations in academic integrity”, including using “fictitious data” in research. A study carried out by Darrel Francis at Imperial College estimated that these guidelines increased patient mortality by 27%, resulting in 800,000 excess deaths over eight years across Europe. \\n\\nThe lack of the medical profession’s awareness of the true extent of biased reporting and scientific fraud is underpinned by universities’ and medical journals’ reliance on the belief that research they produce is ethical and accurate. In evidence submitted to the parliamentary science and technology committee, cardiologist Peter Wilmshurst points out they are “as likely to admit the full magnitude of research misconduct as church leaders are to confess the extent of child abuse by priests”.\\nPharma companies are not legally bound to sell patients the best treatment, but they are obliged to provide profit for shareholders. Between 2009 and 2014, the industry received fines totalling $13bn for criminal behaviour that included illegal marketing of drugs, hiding data on harms and manipulation of results.

Closer scrutiny revealed there was no reduction in death rates from heart disease, no reduction in deaths from any cause, and in European participants in the trial there was no reduction in any non-fatal heart attacks. In fact, there were 18 more deaths in patients who received the drug than those who didn’t.\\nThe battle we face in healthcare is one of “truth versus money”, according to former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine Marcia Angell. After almost two decades editing the journal, she reluctantly concluded that it was no longer possible to trust much of the literature that was published or rely on the authority of physicians or medical guidelines.\\nThe Academy of Medical Sciences has called for greater use of medicines to prevent rather than treat disease. This will be music to the ears of the drug industry, which can exploit a market in treating chronic disease by selling more pills.\\nCarl Heneghan, director of the Centre of Evidence Based-Medicine at Oxford University, said in response “there are too many people with conflicts of interest taking decisions about policy and the way forward”. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWill the healthcare data revolution spell the end for doctors' autonomy?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSystemic failure to regulate against the excesses of Big Food and Big Pharma is a false economy.

       " 'Cabinet resignations, a government with no majority in the Commons, a make-or break-budget for the chancellor and a fast-approaching Brexit negotiating deadline means it is easy for issues to slip out of the public consciousness. Against this backdrop, Euratom and the UK’s future nuclear safeguarding regime risk being forgotten.\\nAs the nuclear safeguards bill - one of the “Brexit bills” announced in the Queen’s speech – makes its way through the parliamentary process, nuclear experts were called to present evidence to MPs. The message from experts is unequivocal – there is no upside to the UK leaving the Euratom treaty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are heading for a senseless nuclear Brexit - with no political or legal mandate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBe it Prospect, the trade union representing civil nuclear experts, EDF Energy, or the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), the sector is united in its message to the government: leaving Euratom is complicated, and the potential consequences could be disastrous for our country. Rupert Cowen, a nuclear expert at Prospect Law, claims the UK is “sleepwalking” to disaster: “If we do not get this right, business stops ... no nuclear trade will be able to continue.”\\nThis is not scaremongering. Analysis of the facts shows just how much is at risk by leaving Euratom, and how complex this process is, given the government’s unnecessary, self-imposed deadline. This government must start listening.\\nEuratom, among other things, provides safeguarding inspections for all civil nuclear sites in the UK. Inspectors are employed by Euratom and many are EU nationals. It takes five years to train a nuclear inspector and there is currently a limited pool of qualified inspectors from which to recruit. As Sue Ferns, deputy general secretary of Prospect, said in her evidence to the nuclear safeguards bill committee, “this is a highly skilled, very specialist area, which is why there is such a premium on this source of labour” and this is why we must question the wisdom of the government’s actions so far.\\nThe government plans for the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) to take over the role that Euratom currently carries out, but the ONR and the NIA have made clear that new arrangements will not be in place by the time we are due to leave Euratom in March 2019. Asked by MPs whether new arrangements could be put in place within the timeframe, Dame Sue Ion, chair of the Nuclear Innovation and Research Advisory Board, said: “I do not think it is possible.”\\nShould the UK fail to have its safeguarding regime in place by March 2019, nuclear trade would halt, as well as cross-nation technology sharing that some of our nuclear power stations rely on to function. Again, this is not an exaggeration of the problem, or political point-scoring. Put simply, if we don’t have our safeguarding regime in place, our nuclear industry will face major, potentially dangerous, disruptions.\\nDespite protests from government ministers, leaving Euratom at the same time as leaving the European Union is not necessary. Euratom is a separate treaty to our EU membership and it is time the government treated it as such, rather than claiming the two are inextricably intertwined.\\nOur civil nuclear industry and Euratom, like so much of the Brexit negotiations, is incredibly complex and it is absolutely vital that we get these negotiations right. Remaining part of Euratom for a transition period may act as a safety net, giving the industry the time it needs to prepare to leave Euratom, but the EU will demand that European courts oversee the arrangements, which of course crosses one of Theresa May’s negotiating red lines.\\nReleasing the impact assessment that the government has carried out on our nuclear industry would be a step in the right direction, rather than rushing through policy with little scrutiny and condemning Brexit opponents as unpatriotic mutineers.\\nIt is time for this government to release itself from unnecessary self-imposed straightjackets, stop focussing on narrow party disputes and start listening and put the interests and the safety of the nation first.',\n",

       " 'Their structures are still standing more than 1,500 years after the last centurion snuffed it: now the Romans’ secret of durable marine concrete has finally been cracked.\\nThe Roman recipe – a mix of volcanic ash, lime (calcium oxide), seawater and lumps of volcanic rock – held together piers, breakwaters and harbours. Moreover, in contrast to modern materials, the ancient water-based structures became stronger over time.\\nScientists say this is the result of seawater reacting with the volcanic material in the cement and creating new minerals that reinforced the concrete.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n“They spent a tremendous amount of work [on developing] this – they were very, very intelligent people,” said Marie Jackson, a geologist at the University of Utah and co-author of a study into Roman structures.\\nAs the authors note, the Romans were aware of the virtues of their concrete, with Pliny the Elder waxing lyrical in his Natural History that it is “impregnable to the waves and every day stronger”.\\n Now, they say, they’ve worked out why. Writing in the journal American Mineralogist, Jackson and colleagues describe how they analysed concrete cores from Roman piers, breakwaters and harbours.\\nPrevious work had revealed lime particles within the cores that surprisingly contained the mineral aluminous tobermorite – a rare substance that is hard to make.\\nThe mineral, said Jackson, formed early in the history of the concrete, as the lime, seawater and volcanic ash of the mortar reacted together in a way that generated heat. \\nBut now Jackson and the team have made another discovery. “I went back to the concrete and found abundant tobermorite growing through the fabric of the concrete, often in association with phillipsite [another mineral],” she said. \\nShe said this revealed another process that was also at play. Over time, seawater that seeped through the concrete dissolved the volcanic crystals and glasses, with aluminous tobermorite and phillipsite crystallising in their place.\\nThese minerals, say the authors, helped to reinforce the concrete, preventing cracks from growing, with structures becoming stronger over time as the minerals grew.\\nBy contrast, modern concrete, based on Portland cement, is not supposed to change after it hardens – meaning any reactions with the material cause damage.\\n Jackson said: “I think [the research] opens up a completely new perspective for how concrete can be made – that what we consider corrosion processes can actually produce extremely beneficial mineral cement and lead to continued resilience, in fact, enhanced perhaps resilience over time.”\\nThe findings offer clues for a concrete recipe that does not rely on the high temperatures and carbon dioxide production of modern cement, but also providing a blueprint for a durable construction material for use in marine environments. Jackson has previously argued Roman concrete should be used to build the seawall for the Swansea lagoon.\\n“There’s many applications but further work is needed to create those mixes. We’ve started but there is a lot of fine-tuning that needs to happen,” said Jackson. “The challenge is to develop methods that use common volcanic products – and that is actually what we are doing right now.”',\n",
       " 'In February 2015, Sergio Canavero appeared in this very publication claiming a live human head will be successfully transplanted onto a donor human body within two years. He’s popped up in the media a lot since then, but two years and nine months later, how are things looking? \\nWell, he’s only gone and done it! As we can see in this Telegraph story from today, the world’s first human head transplant has been successfully carried out. Guess all those more timid neurobods who said it couldn’t be done (myself included) are feeling pretty foolish right now, eh? \\nWell, not quite. Because if you look past the triumphant and shocking headlines, the truth of the matter becomes very clear, very quickly. In the interest of full disclosure, I do not know Dr Sergio Canavero, he’s done nothing to me directly that I’m aware of. However, I’m now seriously doubting his motivations. I’ve discussed my reasons for this elsewhere before now, but here they are again in one place for ease of reading.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Even the fictional Dr Frankenstein had a better success rate. Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images\\n\\n\\nThese “successful” procedures are anything but\\nMany of Canavero’s previous appearances in the media have been accompanied by claims of successful head transplant procedures. But, how are we defining “successful” here? Canavero’s definition seems to be extremely “generous” at best. \\nFor instance, he recently claimed to have “successfully” performed a head transplant on a monkey. But did he? While the monkey head did apparently survive the procedure, it never regained consciousness, it was only kept alive for 20 hours for “ethical reasons” and there was no attempt made at connecting the spinal cord, so even if the monkey had survived long-term it would have been paralysed for life. So, it was a successful procedure, if you consider paralysis, lack of consciousness and a lifespan of less than a day as indicators of “success”. \\nThere was also his “successful” rat head transplant, which involved grafting a severed rat head onto a different rat, a living one that still had its head. Exactly how this counts as a “transplant” is anyone’s guess. It’s adding a (functionally useless) appendage onto an otherwise healthy subject. \\nAnd this recent successful human head transplant? It was on corpses! Call me a perfectionist if you must, but I genuinely think that any surgical procedure where the patients or subjects die before it even starts is really stretching the definition of “success” to breaking point. Maybe the procedure did make a good show of “attaching” the nerves and blood vessels on the broad scale, but, so what? That’s just the start of what’s required for a working bodily system. There’s still a way to go. You can weld two halves of different cars together and call it a success if you like, but if the moment you turn the key in the ignition the whole thing explodes, most would be hard pressed to back you up on your brilliance. \\nPerhaps the techniques used to preserve the heads and attach them have some scientific value, but it’s still a far cry from the idea of someone wandering around with a fully functional body that isn’t the one they were born with. Canavero seems to have a habit of claiming barnstorming triumph based on negligible achievements, or even after making things much worse. He seems to be the neurosurgical equivalent of the UK Brexit negotiating team.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  You’d expect copious details when it comes to performing a successful head transplant. Thus far, they’re strangely absent. Photograph: Alamy\\n\\n\\nThe crucial details are strangely overlooked\\nThe human body is not modular. You can’t swap bits around like you would Lego blocks, take a brick from castle and put it onto a pirate ship and have it work fine. There are copious obstacles to contend with when linking a head to body, even when they’re the same person’s. Doctors have, in recent years, “reattached” a severely damaged spinal cord in a young child, but the key-word is “damaged”, not “completely severed”; there’s enough connection still to work with, to repair and reinforce. And this is with a young child, with a still-developing nervous system better able to compensate. Even taking all this into account, and the advanced state of modern medicine, the successful procedure was considered borderline miraculous. \\nSo, to attach a completely severed spinal cord, a fully developed adult one, onto a different one, one that’s maybe been dead for days? That’s, what, at least four further miracles required? And that’s not to take into account immune rejection, the fact that we don’t really know how to “fix” damaged nerves yet (let alone connect two unfamiliar halves) and the issue that everyone’s brain develops in tune with their body. The latter point means the “interface” between the two is relatively unique. You put the head of musician on the body of a builder, it may well prove to be like trying to play an Xbox game on a PlayStation. Except, infinitely more traumatic. \\nWe don’t know for certain of course, because nobody has ever tried it. Canavero seems convinced he can do it, but thus far he’s offered no feasible explanation or science for his claims to be able to overcome these hurdles, beyond some token stuff about preserving tissues and ensuring blood supply during procedures. That’s a bit like someone claiming they can build a working fusion reactor and, when asked how, explains how they’re going to plumb in the toilets for the technicians. Arguably a useful step, but clearly not the main issue here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  TED Talks. Slick, inspiring, interesting, not exactly peer-reviewed. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo\\n\\n\\nHype before substance\\nI’ve said this before, even in a Wired article about Canavero’s previous claims, to the extent where I am considering trademarking it as “Burnett’s law”. Simply put; if someone’s making grand scientific claims but hasn’t provided robust evidence for them, yet they have done a TED talk, alarm bells should be ringing.\\nI don’t know what Canavero’s confidence is based on. Nobody seems to. He hasn’t published anything that would warrant it thus far. Note his recent “successful” human head transplant claims, which you can read about in the Telegraph before he’s published the actual results, as stated in the article. \\nWhy do that? Why tell the newspapers before you tell your peers? If your procedure is rigorous and reliable enough, the data should reflect that. When scientists, particularly self-styled “mavericks”, court publicity but desperately avoid scrutiny, that’s never an encouraging sign. \\nGoing by the Telegraph article, Canavero claims that the next step will be to attempt a transplant with someone in a vegetative state or similar. He also claims to have plenty of volunteers for this. Exactly how coma patients actively volunteered for this radical procedure is anyone’s guess.\\nThere’s no mention yet of attempting it in a conscious person, despite there being actual volunteers for that. I strongly suspect there never will be. Trying it with a conscious, thinking person means it absolutely has to be 100% effective for them to remain in this state after the transplant is done. This would mean finding workable solutions to all the considerable obstacles presented by the very concept of a head transplant. \\nIf I’m wrong about this then I’ll gladly take back everything and apologise, but nothing Canavero has said or done thus far leads me to think he has any idea about how to do this.\\nDean Burnett is fully aware that the procedure should logically be called a “body transplant” but that’s not how it’s usually described, so has used the more common terms. His book The Idiot Brain is available now, in the UK and US and elsewhere.',\n",
       " \"Astronomers are now certain that the mysterious object detected hurtling past our sun last month is indeed from another solar system. They have named it 1I/2017 U1(’Oumuamua) and believe it could be one of 10,000 others lurking undetected in our cosmic neighbourhood.\\nThe certainty of its interstellar origin comes from an analysis that shows its orbit is almost impossible to achieve from within our solar system.\\nIts name comes from a Hawaiian term for messenger or scout. Indeed, it is the first space rock to have been identified as forming around another star. Since asteroids coalesce during the process of planet formation, this object can tell us something about the formation of planets around its unknown parent star. \\nThe latest analyses with ground-based telescopes show that ’Oumuamua is quite similar to some comets and asteroids in our own solar system. This is important because it suggests that planetary compositions like ours could be typical across the galaxy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMysterious object seen speeding past sun could be 'visitor from another star system'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is thought to be an extremely dark object, absorbing 96% of the light that falls on its surface, and it is red. This colour is the hallmark of organic (carbon-based) molecules. Organic molecules are the building blocks of the biological molecules that allow life to function. \\nIt is widely thought that the delivery of organic molecules to the early Earth by the collision of comets and asteroids made life here possible. ’Oumuamua shows that the same could be possible in other solar systems.\\n\\n\\n\\nIts characteristics have been published by two independent groups of astronomers. The first group, led by Karen Meech, University of Hawaii, also found that ’Oumuamua was extremely elongated and roughly 400 metres long. Using the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope(VLT) they also found that it rotated once every 7.3 hours.\\nThe other group of astronomers, led by David Jewitt, University of California Los Angeles, estimated how many other interstellar visitors like it there might be in our solar system.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStarwatch: First interstellar visitor's name is nod to Hawaiian sighting\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSurprisingly, they calculate that another 10,000 could be closer to the sun than the eighth planet, Neptune, which lies 30 times further from the sun than the Earth. Yet these are currently undetected.\\nEach of these interstellar interlopers would be just passing through. They are travelling too fast to be captured by the gravity of the sun. Yet it still takes them about a decade to cross our solar system and disappear back into interstellar space.\\nIf this estimate is correct, then roughly 1,000 enter and another 1,000 leave every year – which means that roughly three arrive and three leave every day.\\nUsing robotic telescopes such as Pan-STARRS, the one that detected ’Oumuamua, to look for asteroids is a priority for astronomers as they concentrate on discovering potentially hazardous objects that could impact Earth.\\nImminent upgrades to these survey telescopes and improvements in data processing techniques mean that astronomers will soon be able to detect smaller and fainter objects. They expect a number of these to be interstellar interlopers like ’Oumuamua.\\nStuart Clark is the author of The Unknown Universe (Head of Zeus).\",\n",

       " 'Every situation in which language is used – texting your mates, asking for a pay rise, composing a small ad, making a speech, drafting a will, writing up an experiment, praying, rapping, or any other – has its own conventions. You wouldn\\'t expect a politician being interviewed by Kirsty Wark about the economy to start quoting Ludacris: \"I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind; but you\\'se a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind.\" Although it might make Newsnight more entertaining.\\nThis renders the concept of what is \"correct\" more than a simple matter of right and wrong. What is correct in a tweet might not be in an essay; no single register of English is right for every occasion. Updating your status on Facebook is instinctive for anyone who can read and write to a basic level; for more formal communication, the conventions are harder to grasp and this is why so many people fret about the \"rules\" of grammar.\\n10 things people worry about too much\\n1 To infinitive and beyondGeoffrey K Pullum, a scarily erudite linguistics professor – and, unless this is an internet hoax, keyboard player in the 1960s with Geno Washington & the Ram Jam Band – calls them \"zombie rules: though dead, they shamble mindlessly on …\\xa0\" And none more so than the one that says the particle to and the infinitive form of the verb should not be separated, as in Star Trek\\'s eloquent mission statement \"to boldly go where no man has gone before\".\\nStubbornly to resist splitting infinitives can sound awkward or, worse, ambiguous: \"He offered personally to guarantee the loan that the Clintons needed to buy their house\" makes it unclear whether the offer, or the guarantee, was personal. Adverbs should go where they sound most natural, often immediately after the to: to boldly go, to personally guarantee. This \"rule\" is not just half-baked: it\\'s fully baked, with a fried egg and slice of pineapple on top. But remarkably persistent.\\n2 The things one has to put up withPrepositions relate one word or phrase to another, typically to express place (to the office, in the net) or time (before the flood, after the goldrush). They are followed by an object: from me to you.\\nIn the 17th century, John Dryden, deciding that ending a sentence with a preposition was \"not elegant\" because you couldn\\'t do it in Latin, set about ruining some of his best prose by rewriting it so that \"the end he aimed at\" became \"the end at which he aimed\", and so on. Like not splitting the infinitive, this became a \"rule\" when taught by grammarians influenced by Latin.\\nIgnore it. As HW Fowler observed: \"The power of saying \\'people worth talking to\\' instead of \\'people with whom it is worth while to talk\\' is not one to be lightly surrendered.\"\\n3 Don\\'t get in a bad mood over\\xa0the subjunctiveThe subjunctive is a verb form (technically, \"mood\") expressing hypothesis, typically to indicate that something is being demanded, proposed, imagined, or insisted: \"he demanded that she resign\", and so on. You can spot it in the third person singular of the present tense (resign instead of resigns) and in the forms be and were of the verb to be: if she were [rather than was] honest, she would quit.\\nThe writer Somerset Maugham, who in 1949 announced \"the subjunctive mood is in its death throes\", might be surprised to see my son Freddie\\'s bookshelf, which contains If I Were a Pig … (Jellycat Books, 2008).\\nThe subjunctive is more common in American than British English, often in formal or poetic contexts – in the song If I Were a Rich Man, for example. It\\'s not true, however, that David and Don Was came under pressure from language purists to change the name of their band to Were (Not Was).\\nMisusing the subjunctive is worse than not using it at all. Many writers scatter \"weres\" about as if \"was\" were – or, indeed, was – going out of fashion. The journalist Simon Heffer is a fan of the subjunctive, recommending such usages as \"if I be wrong, I shall be defeated\". So be it – if you want to sound like a pirate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Mick Jagger: can\\'t get no satisfaction. Photograph: Ray Green\\n\\n\\n4 Negative, captainWhen Mick Jagger first sang \"I can\\'t get no satisfaction\", it was not uncommon to hear the older generation witter on like this: \"He says he can\\'t get no satisfaction, which logically means he can get some satisfaction.\"\\nBut while a double negative may make a positive when you multiply minus three by minus two, language doesn\\'t work in such a logical way: multiple negatives add emphasis. Literature and music abound with them. Chaucer used a triple – \"He nevere yet no vileynye ne sayde\" – and Ian Dury gave us: \"Just \\'cos I ain\\'t never \\'ad, no, nothing worth having, never ever, never ever.\"\\nNot Standard English, it\\'s true, but no native English speaker is likely to misunderstand, any more than when Jane Austen produced the eloquent double negative \"there was none too poor or remote not to feel an interest\".\\n5 Between my souvenirsI was taught that between applies only to two things, and among should be used for more than two – a rare example of Mrs Birtles, my first grammar teacher, getting it wrong. Between is appropriate when the relationship is reciprocal, however many parties are involved: an agreement between the countries of the EU, for example. Among belongs to collective relationships, as in votes shared among political parties, or the items among Paul Whiteman\\'s souvenirs in the 1927 song.\\nWhile I am on the subject, it\\'s \"between you and me\", not \"between you and I\". It\\'s probably unfair, though quite good fun, to blame the Queen; people have heard \"my husband and I\" and perhaps assume \"and I\" is always right. It is when part of the subject (\"my husband and I would love to see you at the palace\") but not when part of the object (\"the Queen offered my husband and me cucumber sandwiches\").\\n6 Bored of Tunbridge WellsTraditionalists say it should be bored by or bored with, but not bored of, a \"rule\" cheerfully ignored, I would say, by anyone under about 40. And good luck to them: there is no justification for it. I have, however, managed to come up with a little distinction worth preserving: compare \"bored with Tunbridge Wells\" (a person who finds Tunbridge Wells boring) with \"bored of Tunbridge Wells\" (a bored person who happens to live there, perhaps a neighbour of \"disgusted of Tunbridge\\xa0Wells\").\\n7 Don\\'t fear the gerundGeoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle\\'s guide to life at St Custard\\'s school, How to Be Topp, features a cartoon in which a gerund attacks some peaceful pronouns, but it is nothing to be afraid of. A gerund is a verb ending in -ing that acts as a noun: I like swimming, smoking is bad for you, and so on.\\nThe tricky bit is when someone tells you about the rule that, as with other nouns, you have to use a possessive pronoun – \"she objected to my swimming\". Most normal people say \"she objected to me swimming\" so I wouldn\\'t worry about this. You rarely see the possessive form in newspapers, for example. Announcing \"I trust too much in my team\\'s being able to string a few wins together\" sounds pompous.\\n8 And another thing …Conjunctions, as the name suggests, join things together. This prompted generations of English teachers to drill into their pupils, including me, that to start a sentence with and, but, because or however was wrong. But this is another shibboleth. And I am sure William Blake (\"And did those feet in ancient times?\") and the Beatles (\"Because the world is round it turns me on\") would back me on this.\\n9 None senseA sure sign of a pedant is that, under the impression that none is an abbreviation of not one, they will insist on saying things like \"none of them has turned up\". Why, when I set out on the road to grammatical perfection I might even have argued this myself. But the \"rule\" that none always takes a singular verb is, alas, another myth. Plural is not only acceptable, but often sounds more natural: \"None of the current squad are good enough to play in the Championship.\" Henry Fielding wrote in Tom Jones: \"None are more ignorant than those learned Pedants, whose Lives have been entirely consumed in Colleges, and among Books.\"\\n10 Try and try againTry to has traditionally been regarded as more \"correct\" and try and as a colloquialism or worse. The former is certainly more formal, and far more common in writing, but it\\'s the other way round when it comes to speech. Those who regard try and as an \"Americanism\" will be disappointed to learn that it is much more widely used in the UK than in the US. Sometimes there is a good case for try and – for example, if you want to avoid repeating the word to in a sentence such as: \"We\\'re really going to try and win this one.\"\\nAs Bart Simpson said: \"I can\\'t promise I\\'ll try, but I\\'ll try to try.\"\\nFive things people should worry about\\xa0more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Who or whom? The Ghostbusters know which call to make Photograph: Snap/Rex Features\\n\\n\\n1 To who it may concernThe use of whom – the objective form of who – is dying out, especially in speech. It sounds affected and stiff. Hyper-correct use of whom for who is common, as in Graham Greene\\'s The Quiet American: \"There was a big man whom [sic] I think was an hôtelier from Phnom Penh and a French girl I\\'d never seen before.\"\\nTo avoid this, mentally replace who or whom with the third person pronoun: if you get a subject – he, she, it or they – then who is correct; for an object – him, her or them – whom is right. In the Greene example it would be \"I think he was an hôtelier\" not \"I think him was an hôtelier\" – so who, not whom, is correct.\\nWhen John Donne wrote \"for whom the bell tolls\" and Bo Diddley asked \"who do you love?\" who was right – Donne or Diddley? The answer is both of them. It goes back to formal and informal registers. Bo\\'s got a cobra snake for a necktie. Not the kind of guy, I suggest, who would say something wussy like \"whom do you love?\" (It\\'s the same with the Ghostbusters, whose slogan, you may recall, was not \"whom you gonna call?\")\\nThe relaxed tone we prefer these days makes whom increasingly optional, unlike in Donne\\'s day. The elegant formality of his prose has an eloquence and resonance that \"for who the bell tolls\" lacks. Good title for a book, though.\\n2 That\\'s the way to do itThe traditional definition is that that defines and which informs (gives extra information), as in: \"This is the house that Jack built; but this house, which John built, is falling down.\" Note that the sentence remains grammatical without that (\"this is the house Jack built\") but not without which.\\nDon\\'t be alarmed by the unhelpful terms, but restrictive relative clauses (also known as defining, best thought of as giving essential information by narrowing it down) are not enclosed by commas, whereas non-restrictive relative clauses (non-defining, giving non-essential information) are.\\n\"Which John built\" is non-restrictive. It gives extra information, is preceded by a comma, and if you try it with \"that\" it sounds odd (\"this house, that Jack built\"). It\\'s not the same the other way round: although that is more common in restrictive clauses, you can use which: \"This is the house which John built.\"\\nTo simplify things, here\\'s my easy-to-remember formula:Restrictive clauses: that (desirable), no comma (essential).Non-restrictive clauses: which, comma (both essential).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Nothing compares to Prince\\'s mastery of grammar. Photograph: Michael Putland/Getty Images\\n\\n\\n3 Nothing compares 2 UPrince was right; so was Shakespeare (\"Shall I compare thee to a summer\\'s day?). Compare to means liken to; compare with means make a comparison. So I might compare Lionel Messi with Diego Maradona to assess their relative merits, then conclude that Messi can be compared to Maradona – he is a similarly great player. The two phrases have usefully distinct meanings and, although \"compare to\" can be replaced by \"liken to\", it\\'s clumsier to replace \"compare with\" with another phrase.\\n4 A singular problem\"Agreement\" or \"concord\". Yes,\\xa0more off-putting terms for what is\\xa0a straightforward enough rule: be consistent. Gerry Goffin and Carole King, who composed the Monkees\\' 1967 hit Pleasant Valley Sunday, wrote: \"The local rock group down the street is tryin\\' hard to learn their song.\" It\\xa0jars.\\nBut wait, I hear you cry. Who says a rock group are singular? There were, after all, four of them, too busy singing to put anybody down. Quite so. If I had wandered into the Brill Building in New York and caught Goffin or King\\'s ear at the time, I would have politely suggested \"are tryin\\' hard to learn their song\" as the answer.\\nCollective nouns can be singular or plural. Treat as singular when the\\xa0noun\\xa0is a single unit, but plural when it is more a collection of individuals, for example: \"The family\\xa0can trace its history back to the middle ages; the family were sitting down, scratching their heads.\" Once you\\'ve decided whether the noun is singular or plural, make sure the verb agrees, or people will conclude you is sloppy.\\n5 Lie lady lieConfusion between the verbs lay\\xa0and lie arises because the present\\xa0tense of the former is the past tense of the latter. The easy way not to mix them up is to remember that lay is a transitive verb (it takes an object); lie is intransitive. If you lay a table or an egg, or you lay something down, the past tense is laid. If you lie down, the past tense is lay. You will note that strictly – as Bob Dylan was inviting the lady in question to lie down across his big brass bed, rather than reporting that she had done so in the past – he should have sung \"Lie Lady Lie\" rather than \"Lay Lady Lay\". If you try singing it like that, however, it sounds Australian, which would not really have worked on an album called Nashville Skyline.\\nThe sounds of syntax: What pop music can teach us about how to build a sentence\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  James Brown: feels good, has a soul.

       " \"Fossils recovered from an old mine on a desolate mountain in Morocco have rocked one of the most enduring foundations of the human story: that Homo sapiens arose in a cradle of humankind in East Africa 200,000 years ago.\\n Archaeologists unearthed the bones of at least five people at Jebel Irhoud, a former barite mine 100km west of Marrakesh, in excavations that lasted years. They knew the remains were old, but were stunned when dating tests revealed that a tooth and stone tools found with the bones were about 300,000 years old.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy we're closer than ever to a timeline for human evolution\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“My reaction was a big ‘wow’,” said Jean-Jacques Hublin, a senior scientist on the team at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig. “I was expecting them to be old, but not that old.”\\nHublin said the extreme age of the bones makes them the oldest known specimens of modern humans and poses a major challenge to the idea that the earliest members of our species evolved in a “Garden of Eden” in East Africa one hundred thousand years later.\\n“This gives us a completely different picture of the evolution of our species. It goes much further back in time, but also the very process of evolution is different to what we thought,” Hublin told the Guardian. “It looks like our species was already present probably all over Africa by 300,000 years ago. If there was a Garden of Eden, it might have been the size of the continent.”\\nJebel Irhoud has thrown up puzzles for scientists since fossilised bones were first found at the site in the 1960s. Remains found in 1961 and 1962, and stone tools recovered with them, were attributed to Neanderthals and at first considered to be only 40,000 years old. At the time, a popular view held that modern humans evolved from Neanderthals. Today, the Neanderthals are considered a sister group that lived alongside, and even bred with, our modern human ancestors.\\n\\nJebel Irhoud locator\\n\\nIn fresh excavations at the Jebel Irhoud site, Hublin and others found more remains, including a partial skull, a jawbone, teeth and limb bones belonging to three adults, a juvenile, and a child aged about eight years old. The remains, which resemble modern humans more than any other species, were recovered from the base of an old limestone cave that had its roof smashed in during mining operations at the site. Alongside the bones, researchers found sharpened flint tools, a good number of gazelle bones, and lumps of charcoal, perhaps left over from fires that warmed those who once lived there.\\n “It’s rather a desolate landscape, but on the horizon you have the Atlas mountains with snow on top and it’s very beautiful,” said Hublin. “When we found the skull and mandible I was emotional. They are only fossils, but they have been human beings and very quickly you make a connection with these people who lived and died here 300,000 years ago.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  The first almost complete adult mandible discovered at the site of Jebel Irhoud. The bone morphology and the dentition display a combination of archaic and evolved features. Photograph: Credit: Jean-Jacques Hublin, MPI-EVA, Leipzig\\n\\n\\n Scientists have long looked to East Africa as the birthplace of modern humans. Until the latest findings from Jebel Irhoud, the oldest known remnants of our species were found at Omo Kibish in Ethiopia and dated to 195,000 years old. Other fossils and genetic evidence all point to an African origin for modern humans.\\n In the first of two papers published in Nature on Wednesday, the researchers describe how they compared the freshly-excavated fossils with those of modern humans, Neanderthals and ancient human relatives that lived up to 1.8m years ago. Facially, the closest match was with modern humans. The lower jaw was similar to modern Homo sapiens too, but much larger. The most striking difference was the shape of the braincase which was more elongated than that of humans today. It suggests, said Hublin, that the modern brain evolved in Homo sapiens and was not inherited from a predecessor.\\n Apart from being more stout and muscular, the adults at Jebel Irhoud looked similar to people alive today. “The face of the specimen we found is the face of someone you could meet on the tube in London,” Hublin said. In a second paper, the scientists lay out how they dated the stone tools to between 280,000 and 350,000 years, and a lone tooth to 290,000 years old.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  The tools found were based on a knapping technique called Levallois, adding to the realisation that the sophisticated way of shaping tools originated earlier than thought. Photograph: Credit: Mohammed Kamal, MPI EVA Leipzig\\n\\n\\n The remains of more individuals may yet be found at the site. But precisely what they were doing there is unclear. Analysis of the flint tools shows that the stones came not from the local area, but from a region 50km south of Jebel Irhoud. “Why did they come here? They brought their toolkit with them and they exhausted it,” Hublin said. “The tools they brought with them have been resharpened, resharpened, and resharpened again. They did not produce new tools on the spot. It might be that they did not stay that long, or maybe it was an area they would come to do something specific. We think they were hunting gazelles, there are a lot of gazelle bones, and they were making a lot of fires.”\\n Hublin concedes that scientists have too few fossils to know whether modern humans had spread to the four corners of Africa 300,000 years ago. The speculation is based on what the scientists see as similar features in a 260,000-year-old skull found in Florisbad in South Africa.\\nBut he finds the theory compelling. “The idea is that early Homo sapiens dispersed around the continent and elements of human modernity appeared in different places, and so different parts of Africa contributed to the emergence of what we call modern humans today,” he said.\\nJohn McNabb, an archaeologist at the University of Southampton, said: “One of the big questions about the emergence of anatomically modern humans has been did our body plan evolve quickly or slowly. This find seems to suggest the latter. It seems our faces became modern long before our skulls took on the shape they have today.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Two views of a composite reconstruction of the earliest known\\nHomo sapiens fossils from Jebel Irhoud The braincase (blue) indicates that brain shape, and possibly brain function, evolved within the\\nHomo sapiens lineage. Photograph: Credit: Philipp Gunz, MPI EVA Leipzig\\n\\n\\n“There are some intriguing possibilities here too. The tools the people at Jebel Irhoud were making were based on a knapping technique called Levallois, a sophisticated way of shaping stone tools. The date of 300,000 years ago adds to a growing realisation that Levallois originates a lot earlier than we thought. Is Jebel Irhoud telling us that this new technology is linked to the emergence of the hominin line that will lead to modern humans? Does the new find imply there was more than one hominin lineage in Africa at this time? It really stirs the pot.”\\nLee Berger, whose team recently discovered the 300,000 year-old Homo naledi, an archaic-looking human relative, near the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage site outside Johannesburg, said dating the Jebel Irhoud bones was thrilling, but is unconvinced that modern humans lived all over Africa so long ago. “They’ve taken two data points and not drawn a line between them, but a giant map of Africa,” he said.\\nJohn Shea, an archaeologist at Stony Brook University in New York who was not involved in the study, said he was cautious whenever researchers claimed they had found the oldest of anything. “It’s best not to judge by the big splash they make when they are first announced, but rather to wait and see some years down the line whether the waves from that splash have altered the shoreline,” he said, adding that stone tools can move around in cave sediments and settle in layers of a different age.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHomo naledi genome: Will we ever find this elusive key to human evolution? | Jennifer Raff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShea was also uneasy with the scientists combining fossils from different individuals, and comparing reconstructions of complete skulls from fragmentary remains. “Such ‘chimeras’ can look very different from the individuals on which they are based,” he said.\\n“For me, claiming these remains are Homo sapiens stretches the meaning of that term a bit,” Shea added. “These humans who lived between 50,000-300,000 years ago are a morphologically diverse bunch. Whenever we find more than a couple of them from the same deposits, such as at Omo Kibish and Herto in Ethiopia or Skhul and Qafzeh in Israel, their morphology is all over the place both within and between samples.”\\n But Jessica Thompson, an anthropologist at Emory University in Atlanta, said the new results show just how incredible the Jebel Irhoud site is. “These fossils are the rarest of the rare because the human fossil record from this time period in Africa is so poorly represented. They give us a direct look at what early members of our species looked like, as well as their behaviour.\\n “You might also look twice at the brow ridges if you saw them on a living person. It might not be a face you’d see every day, but you would definitely recognise it as human,” she said. “It really does look like in Africa especially, but also globally, our evolution was characterised by numerous different species all living at the same time and possibly even in the same places.”\",\n",
       " 'There may come a time in everyone’s life when they find themselves sitting at the kitchen table on an otherwise unexceptional weekday morning, drooling saliva into a test tube in the spirit of scientific inquiry.\\nThe spit is for one of the home genetic-testing kits I’m sampling. A growing number of these kits (brands such as 23andMe, DNAFit, Thriva, MyHeritage DNA, and Orig3n) promise to unlock the mystery of your genomes, variously explaining everything from ancestry, residual Neanderthal variants, “bioinformatics” for fitness, weight loss and skincare, to more random genetic predispositions, denoting, say, the dimensions of your earlobes or the consistency of your\\xa0earwax.\\nMore controversially, some of these kits profess to tell you your biological (as opposed to actual age) by measuring the length of your telomeres (in basic terms, the caps at the end of each strand of DNA that protect chromosomes, like plastic tips at the end of shoelaces). Other tests, such as 23andMe, predict higher risks of developing serious conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, including the test for BRCA1/BRCA2 (breast and ovarian cancer) that Angelina Jolie famously underwent, going on to have a preventative double mastectomy and surgery to remove her ovaries.\\nIt’s easy to do these tests; it’s usually just a case of collecting your own samples at home, filling in short, basic questionnaires, posting the packages, and then logging on to interactive websites for confidential results (all the kits I tested used outside laboratories). With an array of price ranges and options, from one-off DNA-blitzes to targeting specific health areas, to fitness/wellness tracking, it’s no surprise that these kits are proving to be very big business and the field is primed to get even bigger, with a global market estimated to be worth around £7.7bn by 2022.\\nSaying that, what’s it all for? Some individuals, such as Jolie, have the kind of family histories that give them good reason to be concerned about their health, though, as becomes clear, those people might be better off consulting doctors in the normal way.\\nOtherwise, the home-testing kits could be said to fit in with our increasingly health-conscious and, if you wish to be cynical, narcissistic times. What says you’re “special” more than finding out everything about yourself, right down to the nitty-gritty of genetics? In this way, these kits could be viewed as the latest plaything of the “worried well”. You could see how the scientific approach would appeal to the health-obsessed of all sexes and ages, your marathon runners and serious gym-goers, who take their fitness extremely seriously.\\nAnother key customer type could be people like myself, hurtling through middle age, perhaps just starting to feel the cold bony hand of mortality clamp down on their shoulder. People, who, in the past, may not have exactly prioritised their health, who are starting to wonder what may be in store for them and who are in the (“Hypochondriacs R Us”) market for some hard-core insight and\\xa0advice.\\nWhich is all very well, but do these kits work and deliver the service they promise and what about the wider ethics and implications of home genetic testing? Is it always wise for generally under-informed, under-prepared consumers to meddle in the highly complex, nuanced arena of genetics, risking confusion, complacency or even outright panic and anxiety when confronted with ostensible “bad news” (which may not even be true)?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  DNA tests are aimed in part at the ‘worried well’; healthy people who take their fitness seriously. Photograph: Alamy\\n\\n\\nThe first kit I try is Thriva’s baseline test (£49), which, like all its products, checks your blood. The box arrives promptly enough (containing spring-loaded needles, a little collection tube, antiseptic wipes, plasters, etc), but there’s a problem. The idea is to prick your finger and massage blood into the tube, but I just end up making my fingers sore and what I get out barely smears the top of the phial. Maybe it’s just me, but it turns into a right faff. In the end, I take advantage of Thriva’s service to send someone out to take a sample of blood from my arm.\\nWhen we speak, co-founder Hamish Grierson describes Thriva as “a lifestyle brand with medical-grade testing at the back end”, an opportunity for “people to see themselves as consumers rather than patients”. Grierson gives examples of people who have benefited from Thriva testing, sometimes picking up early on serious issues. As for alarming people, Grierson says that Thriva has on-site facilities to discuss results and is intended to be “complementary to the NHS” rather than replacing it: “If there are questions we can’t answer, we’re very clear that people should pick it up with their GP.”\\nWhen my results appear, they show nothing bad. If anything, it’s anticlimactic: cholesterol, vitamins, liver proteins and the like are all in the normal range, with only ferritin (iron stores) slightly high, with a recommendation to go easy on any iron supplements. My problem with the baseline test is that, unlike Thriva’s other products, clients are supposed to have one every three months to keep track, but would I really want (or indeed need) to do such a test so\\xa0regularly?\\nAccording to Margaret McCartney, GP, and author of The Patient Paradox, there’s a fundamental problem with home genetic-testing kits per se.\\n“My concern is that more and more of these tests are being put out, and people are being persuaded to have these tests done, and they get results back that are very often of very low value and dubious helpfulness,” she says. “And often people are told to go to see their GP and that then places a direct stress on the NHS, at no cost to the company. The companies make their profits and walk away, letting the NHS sort out all the fallout, the push-back, from the test results, in a way I find absurd. Why should the NHS have to prop up the problems that these companies create?”\\nIn McCartney’s view, enough testing is already done in this country (sometimes too much) and there are issues of regulation and “informed consent”. “People are given very dramatic reasons to have these tests – it could help save your life, it could help improve the quality of your life – but where is the actual controlled evidence that these tests have ever done that? There’s no evidence that says doing these tests makes people become\\xa0healthier.”\\nMcCartney says that anxious people often contact her, saying they wished they hadn’t done the tests. “These companies often say that it’s worth it for the helpful advice. But I can give you really good advice right now without seeing a single test result: be active, have lots of social networks, do work you enjoy, try not to smoke or drink too much, don’t be overweight or underweight, eat lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. Nobody needs to get tests done to get that kind of basic lifestyle\\xa0advice.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n  Facebook \\n \\n\\n\\n  Twitter \\n \\n\\n\\n  Pinterest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  There are concerns that the NHS will ultimately have to pick up the bill for any problems picked up by DNA tests. Photograph: Getty\\n\\n\\nNor does McCartney care for the “worried well” narrative. “I don’t really like the worried well thing because it moves the blame on to the people themselves. I think people are being made anxious by manipulative advertising. People are generally good. They don’t want to be worried or unwell just for fun”.\\nSome concerns about the ultimate efficacy of certain home tests seem to emanate from the industry itself. I did a telomere-measuring test (a mouth swab) by Titanovo, based in north Colorado, which came back saying that my telomeres were too short, putting me at 10 biological years older than I am. However, when I contacted Titanovo, it explained that it had stopped telomere measuring and was now concentrating exclusively on its DNA-utilising “bioinformatics” health, fitness and wellbeing website (analysing client data from other genetic testing sites).\\nTitanovo explained that it found telomere measuring too inconsistent, with too many super-fit people presenting with short telomeres and unfit people presenting with long ones and, ultimately, everyone receiving pretty much the same advice: start exercising and eating healthily… or continue exercising and eating healthily.\\nBill Newman, professor of translational genomic medicine in the Manchester centre for genomic medicine at the University of Manchester, and chair of the British Society of Genetic Medicine, says that such tests in this context simply don’t make sense and that, usually, telomere testing would only be used in in-depth studies of ageing and diseases associated with ageing. “There’s some really brilliant work going on, by some of the best biologists in the world,” says Newman, citing Elizabeth Blackburn, who won the 2009 Nobel prize for medicine for her work on telomeres. “But there’s no evidence whatsoever that measuring a person’s telomeres gives any indication about their health – or beauty, intelligence, or anything else that might be listed on these sites.”\\nIn Newman’s view, the genie is out of the bottle with home genetic-testing kits. He says that while the kits could potentially provide data in the future, right now, they lack “clinical utility” – they look at genetic variants that, individually, have a very low chance of predicting specific health risks, as there are too many variables: “It’s like the Opportunity Knocks clap-o-meter, with some people further along the scale, and therefore more likely to get the condition and then people at the other end of the scale, who are unlikely to get it.”\\nNewman says that there’s a basic lack of “literacy” and understanding about genetic testing, among the public and even other health professionals. People are given false reassurances or made to panic (just because you have certain genetic variants, it doesn’t mean that you will develop a particular condition). Newman also makes the point that, in his field, counselling happens before and after testing and, while people with cancer or heart issues nearly always opt to have the test (as they can then take action to varying degrees), often people with conditions such as Huntington’s disease in their family decide not to go ahead because a diagnosis would change nothing for them. In any event, Newman says that, with genetic testing, while there are different levels, intensive counselling is always “absolutely key”.\\nAll this comes into sharp focus with the comprehensive kits such as the one provided by 23andMe: the one I drool into a tube for (incidentally, 23andMe doesn’t test for Huntington’s disease). Most people, like myself, have a low understanding of genetic variants, what phrases such as “higher risk” or “probability” actually mean or how to interpret our results correctly. Is it right that ordinary members of the public must navigate potentially frightening and/or misleading results alone?\\nAs it happens, most of the data on 23andMe seems harmless and fun. There are the “Neanderthal variants” (I have fewer of them than 58% of 23andMe customers, thank you very much), the bizarre earwax/earlobes-type data and, apparently, I have the muscle composition generally found in “elite athletes” (fancy). On the downside, my lineage isn’t as exotic as I’d hoped: 99.1% north-western Europe, of which 71% is British/Irish, with just 0.01% “Ashkenazi Jewish” to offset the genetic monotony. At £149, the 23andMe kit isn’t cheap and I’m quite tempted to demand a recount.\\nThen comes the section about serious genetic variants. So far as “counselling” goes, previously, I’d waved away concern for my psychological welfare from the Observer’s science editor (“I’m a former goth,” I said. “My default setting is ‘doomed’”), but it turns out to be quite daunting. It doesn’t help that I initially mistake the full list of potential conditions for my own results, hence (thankfully briefly) thinking that I have higher risk factors for everything going. It makes me wonder – how many other people are going to do that?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n‘We are all mutants now’: the trouble with genetic testing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn fairness to 23andME, it leaves it up to the customer to unlock the more serious results – or not. When I unlock mine, I discover that, while I’m not genetically predisposed to such things as the BRAC1 or BRAC2 variant, Parkinson’s or MS, I have one of the variants for late-onset (mid-80s) Alzheimer’s. However, I don’t have any other markers for Alzheimer’s or family history or conditions associated with it or anything else listed in the rather lengthy disclaimer, which also stresses that it’s not a diagnostic result and to seek further advice from your GP if you are concerned.\\nThis is another feature of these genetic-testing sites – they are littered with caveats and disclaimers, forever emphasising that they’re not actual “diagnostic tests” and, if you are really concerned by your results, to seek further advice from your GP or another health professional. As has been pointed out by McCartney, when anything looks serious, ultimately it’s back to the very GP and exact NHS infrastructure that these kits profess to smoothly bypass.\\nAs a postscript, I eventually end up having an interesting chat with Titanovo about my “bioinformatics” (distilled from my 23andMe data). One of the first things I’m told is that my eyes are green (they’re brown). However, the bioinformatics got my skin type and frame/weight generally right and had interesting (albeit occasionally generic) things to say about exercise, diet, goals, steering clear of too much sugar and so on.\\nWho knows how much of it made solid scientific sense? However, I have to confess that I rather enjoyed it on the level of an indulgent genome-oriented “pampering session”, just as I had a hoot with the ancestry/Neanderthal/earlobe data on 23andMe. Where Thriva is concerned, I also noted that it did advanced thyroid tests. Although such tests are available from the NHS, I’m hypothyroid myself and I know that sometimes it can be difficult and time-consuming getting tests repeated and it could be useful to be privately tested in this way.\\nIt could be that, in the main, genetic-testing kits such as these could, if promoted and used responsibly, end up zoned completely away from legitimate science and medicine and placed where perhaps they belong, firmly in the lifestyle-extra zone, if and when people think they’re “worth it”. Though, somewhat tellingly, when I ask Newman if he thinks that any of the genetic testing kits are worth buying, he instantly says: “No. I’d say, go to the cinema, watch some sport. Spend the money on something nice, something life-enhancing.”\\n100,000 genomes project: how the NHS collects genetic data\\nWhat is the project?The 100,000 Genomes Project is an NHS initiative, run by Genomics England, and is the largest national genome sequencing project in the world. On entering, patients have their entire genome, of more than 3bn base pairs, sequenced. This is different from commercially available genetic testing kits, such as those from 23andMe, which only look at very small stretches of DNA in a process called genotyping. The hope of the NHS is that having so much genetic information, from so many different people, will allow “groundbreaking discoveries about how diseases work, who could be susceptible to them, how we can treat them, and what treatments might work”.\\nWhose genomes are being sequenced?The only patients having their genome sequenced are those with certain cancers or rare diseases. In some cases, family members may also be asked to participate. To take part, a patient must first be referred by a consultant, before being taken through an extensive consent process to ensure they know what participation in the project means. As well as the genome sequence, Genomics England asks for access to a patient’s lifetime medical records so that links can be made between their genetics and their individual disease. The NHS has made it very clear that, for many participants, taking part in this project won’t help them treat their disease. But it is hoped that the information they provide will go on to help treat others in the future.\\nWhere does the data go?Each patient’s genome sequence and their medical records are kept in an NHS data centre in pseudonymised form. Researchers from commercial and not-for-profit organisations can get access to the data at the centre if they can prove that they are using it for studies that will further medical science.\\nWhat information do the patients get back?Although the project states that most participants won’t receive any useful information, patients will be told if something is found in their genome that is relevant to the treatment, explanation or diagnosis of their condition. They can also choose to learn if they have a genetic risk factor for another disease, such as the BRCA1 gene mutation that can cause breast cancer. Genomics England will only look for risk factors that are linked to a disease that can be treated or prevented. Untreatable conditions, such as Alzheimer’s, are not looked for.\\nWhy 100,000 genomes?The NHS believes that sequencing 100,000 genomes will provide enough information on these diseases while also being cost-effective. In the future, as the price of whole genome sequencing goes down, it hopes to involve more patients and even more diseases.\\nAgnes Donnelly',\n",

It wasn’t the physical violence or the verbal abuse or the lack of boundaries and inappropriate behavior. What did the real damage was the denial that these incidents ever occurred. \\nThe erasure of the abuse was worse than the abuse.\\nWhen I was in my mid-30s, I had an encounter with someone who recognized me from when I was a child. “Are you so-and-so’s daughter?” he asked. I nodded. He had been a guest at one of my mother’s parties. After I left, he said: “I had always wondered how that little girl would survive. I had thought her only choices were suicide or murder.”\\nWhen I was told he said this, I felt validation. And that line stayed with me for many reasons. This outsider observed what I was living through, and having him as a witness confirmed what I knew.\\nOne of the most insidious things about gaslighting is the denial of reality. Being denied what you have seen. Being denied what you have experienced and know to be true. It can make you feel like you are crazy. But you are not crazy.\\nDr Robin Stern, associate director at Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and author of The Gaslight Effect says that usually “when people are abused there are signs that you can point to that are much more obvious. Someone who has been hit or threatened for instance – it’s easy to see and understand how they have been hurt. But when someone is manipulating you, you end up second-guessing yourself and turning your attention to yourself as the person to blame”.\\nTo illustrate this, she cites an example that is easy to understand. A close friend of hers was always running late. Initially, she pointed this out to him noting that it was not respectful. His response was to tell her she was “too sensitive”. But over time, when this dynamic would continue to happen, it would lead to arguing and when she persisted he would say, “You really have a problem with time, don’t you?” and she in turn, ended up thinking he might be right. She began to doubt herself. “I began to think – what’s the problem if someone is late, maybe I’m not being flexible enough.’”\\nThis is what she calls the gaslight effect. “Gaslighting over time leads to somebody experiencing the gaslight effect. Someone can try to gaslight you, but it can’t happen unless you allow it.”\\nThis is the tricky part. Because when there is someone in a position of power or authority, someone you idealize, or even as in many co-dependent relationships – when there is someone you are afraid to lose – their insistence that their reality is the reality can often cause you to doubt what you know to be true.\\n“We are living in a time where a lot of people are having a tough time deciding what’s real and feeling like they are being manipulated,” Stern says. “If they know something is true and somebody tells you it’s not true, holding on to your reality is essential. You can’t be gaslighted if you stay inside your own reality and recognize the manipulation when you see it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSmoke and mirrors: how Trump manipulates the media and opponents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat’s happening on a national level is activating and retraumatizing a lot of people who have been gaslighted in the past. The crazy-making, mind-bending, massive confusion-inducing effects of our current administration’s recklessness with the truth and disregard for verifiable facts is creating an emotional and psychological whiplash. It’s affecting people who have been subjected to abusive relationships; people who feel emotionally vulnerable and it seems to stoke a nearly unprecedented rage in those of us who can see it and feel powerless to do anything to combat it. When people in the mainstream media are being discredited, how exactly are you supposed to call this out?\\nThere were some strategies – which I didn’t know at the time were strategies – that helped me survive. And in these uncertain times, it is a way to stay sane.\\nRemain defiant\\nWhen I was a little girl about five or six, I wrote a story about running away from home. When my mother saw that story, she demanded I change it. Why would you write this story? It isn’t about me, is it? She knew it was about her and the chaos at home. I refused to change the story and that defiance was key. Trusting my version of reality. Not allowing it to be altered on demand. Resistance. This anger protected me, because I knew what I knew. It couldn’t be erased. Being defiant does not make you difficult. It makes you resilient.\\nRecognize there will never be accountability\\nThe person who is gaslighting you will never be able to see your point of view or take responsibility for their actions. They will never get it. They will never say, “Oh, you’re right – you have a point.”\\nAcknowledgement is not on the cards. And asserting yourself is not just useless but harmful. Because the person gaslighting will never be able to respond to logic and reason – and so you have to be the one to recognize that logic and reason can’t be applied.\\nLet go of the wish for things to be different\\nThe wish for things to be different is very powerful and inoculates you to the tumult. It allows you to continue to believe logic and reason will prevail. You want to believe the person will change. You want things to make sense. But they won’t. You want to feel you are on safe ground. You have to let go of this wish. Because things will never make sense. You will never be heard.\\nDevelop healthy detachment\\nI had to develop certain coping mechanisms, but there was a price. Behavior that was adaptive as a child becomes maladaptive as an adult: I was not trusting and always needing verification.\\nI became hyper-vigilant about clarity. There was no room for misunderstanding; no margin for error. I needed certainty in an uncertain world. But we live in an uncertain world, so there has to be a way to find balance.\\nDetaching from the gaslighting does not mean total detachment. It means distinguishing between the world of the gaslighter and the real world.\\n“Someone can try to gaslight you and once you can identify what’s going on, you can begin to turn off the gaslighting and heal,” Stern says. She points out that often people are willing to give up their reality in favor of hanging on to a relationship rather than rupturing it.\\nThere are, she says, many different signs to recognize when you’re being gaslighted. “You feel confused and crazy. You’re always apologizing, wondering if you are good enough, can’t understand why you feel so bad all the time, or know something is wrong but can’t put your finger on it. You thought one thing, they say another; you can’t figure out which is right.”\\nA tip she offers for handling things is to write down what actually happened in the conversation. “Once you are not flooded with emotion, you can reflect rationally. Look at the conversation and see where it took a turn.” \\nWhen someone is so certain about what they believe and they keep on insisting and trying to convince you – over a period of time – it erodes your own perception. And having to verify reality is in itself destabilizing.\\nStern poses an interesting question. “Are people upset because current leaders are telling them something they know isn’t true, or is it because they are upset other people might be believing it?”\\nWith gaslighting, it feels as though the ground is always shifting beneath you. There is no center of gravity. And while we’re being told up is down and black is white, the only way to make sense of it is to remain resolute. Let people have their alternative facts. You’ll stick to reality.\"]"
